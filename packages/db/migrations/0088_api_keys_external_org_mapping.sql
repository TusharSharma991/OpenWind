-- analytics: excluded (no new table — column additions only)
--
-- Ported from upstream/tushar's third-party-key-external-org-mapping.md: a
-- third-party API key can trust acting-person tokens from an IdP/org
-- different from the tenant's primary login IdP (tenants.zitadel_org_id, one
-- column, one mapping per tenant). Both new columns are nullable and only
-- ever used together: NULL/NULL means "this key uses the tenant's primary
-- IdP mapping," today's default behavior, completely unchanged. The
-- creation-time validation that enforces they're supplied together (and
-- only when actually needed) lives in apps/api/src/routes/api-keys/create.ts,
-- not here — same pattern as migration 0068's applicationName/
-- applicationContactEmail/oidcClientId, which are also nullable at the DB
-- layer with the real "required for this flow" enforcement at the API
-- layer.
--
-- Down migration:
-- ALTER TABLE "api_keys" DROP COLUMN "external_issuer";
-- ALTER TABLE "api_keys" DROP COLUMN "external_org_id";

ALTER TABLE "api_keys"
  ADD COLUMN "external_issuer" text,
  ADD COLUMN "external_org_id" text;
