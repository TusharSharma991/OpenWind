# CLAUDE.md — Platform Engineering Context

Loaded every session. Rules in `.claude/rules/` auto-load (`code-style`, `agent-behaviour`,
`git-conventions` always; `db-conventions`, `testing-conventions`, `security` when you touch
matching paths).

## What we are building

A modular, workflow-native business platform. Every module (CRM, helpdesk, HRMS,
reimbursements, etc.) is a configuration of three shared engines: Entity Engine, Workflow Engine
and Automation Engine. Modules are seed SQL plus a one-line stub `index.ts`, with no domain-logic
TypeScript in `modules/` (ADR-004). Full architecture: `docs/architecture-brief.md`.

Status and history: `docs/tracker/roadmap-tracker.md` and `docs/tracker/week-log/`, one file per
session. The frozen pre-2026-08-14 log is `week-log/archive/week-log.md`; never edit it. Specs are
indexed in `docs/specs/README.md`.

`docs/sup-docs/` is **gitignored and local-only** (the owner's strategy, pricing and GTM notes).
Never assume a contributor can see it, never cite it from a tracked doc, and never put tracking
content in it.

No phase or track starts without explicit human sign-off. New review findings go through
[docs/reviews/pending-review-findings.md](docs/reviews/pending-review-findings.md); file an issue
before picking one up.

**Delivery:** every change runs Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship, guided by hooks documented
once in [.claude/README.md](.claude/README.md). The completion contract is
[definition-of-done.md](.claude/references/definition-of-done.md). The hooks are guardrails, not a
security boundary; CI plus human PR review is the real gate.

**Off-limits (never touch autonomously):** parallel approval code (#65) · ADR files in
`docs/decisions/` (humans write them) · schema cache / `redis.keys()` fix (deferred to load
testing, #4).

## Repository layout

```
apps/
  api/            Hono API server
  worker/         BullMQ workers (outbox, automations, SLA, schedule tick, notifications, AV scan)
  admin-ui/       Refine + shadcn/ui — the single UI for agents, admins and customers (RBAC);
                  apps/portal is only a workspace stub (source removed in PR #211)
packages/
  db/             Drizzle schema, migrations, client
  entity-engine/  workflow-engine/  automation-engine/
  auth/           Zitadel JWT + RBAC helpers
  notifications/  Novu wrapper
  files/          Tenant-scoped local-disk storage + async ClamAV scan (PR #340; async exports still use S3, #697)
  audit/          Append-only audit log
  config/         Zod-validated env — import from @platform/config

  telemetry/      OTel, Prometheus metrics, PII-scrubbed Sentry (3D)
  tsconfig/       Shared TypeScript base configs
modules/          Seed SQL + one-line stub index.ts per module
tests/            integration/ · isolation/ (tenant RLS, every db/ PR) · e2e/
```

## Dependency rule (ESLint-enforced; `pnpm dep:check` checks the transitive graph)

```
apps/*             → packages/*
modules/*          → packages/*   (no cross-module imports ever)
entity-engine      → db only
workflow-engine    → db, entity-engine
automation-engine  → db, workflow-engine, entity-engine, teams, audit
teams              → db only
scheduler          → db, teams, config, logger   (no package-specific boundary rule yet)
```

Cross-module communication goes through the event bus, the entity-engine relations API, or tRPC
only. To check what depends on a file, run `pnpm dep:impact -- '<path-regex>'`. A stale `dist/`
makes it under-report, so treat an empty result as inconclusive and cross-check with grep (see
`.claude/context/dependency-graph.md`).

---

## Commands

Everything is containerized. `docker compose up -d` is the standard way to run the app, in dev and
on servers alike. It starts Postgres, PgBouncer, Redis, OpenBao, ClamAV, `ow-backend`,
`ow-frontend` and `ow-worker`. Zitadel is a separate compose project (`../zitadel/`, joined via the
external `openwind_zitadel` network). `pnpm dev` is host-mode hot reload for tight loops only; it
is not what CI or servers run.

```bash
docker compose up -d                          # default stack
docker compose --profile notifications up -d  # + Novu
docker compose --profile observability up -d  # + Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager/OTel collector
docker compose --profile reporting up -d      # + Superset (3G)   (also: tools, bootstrap)
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm test:isolation   # exit condition
pnpm test:e2e         # end-to-end API tests (needs the stack)
pnpm db:migrate       # run pending migrations
pnpm db:seed          # seed development data
```

macOS: OrbStack, not Docker Desktop. Windows: run isolation/e2e in CI or WSL2. Full setup:
`docs/local-setup.md`.

## When stuck

1. Read the relevant ADR, then the existing tests — they document expected behavior precisely.
2. Check `.claude/context/` for the engine guide.
3. Check `docs/tracker/roadmap-tracker.md` before changing scope.
4. If a decision isn't covered by an ADR, stop and write it up in BLOCKERS.md. ADRs are
   human-authored, so a human writes the ADR before you implement.

**Dep bumps:** every security override pin lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides:` (pnpm v11
ignores `package.json`'s `pnpm.overrides`), with its advisory and rationale as an inline comment
plus a "Deferred" block. Never remove a pin without reading its comment. Record new advisories
there, not here.
