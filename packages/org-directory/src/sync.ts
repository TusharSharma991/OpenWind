/**
 * docs/specs/org-directory.md T4 -- the sync engine. Only this module (plus
 * the OrgSourceImporter passed in) touches org_employees/org_directory_sync_runs
 * for writes; T6's query API reads them separately.
 *
 * Concurrency (R2): a session-scoped Postgres advisory lock
 * (acquireTenantAdvisoryLock, @platform/db) is acquired non-blockingly before
 * anything else. If another sync is already running for this tenant,
 * acquisition fails immediately and this returns "already_running" without
 * touching org_directory_sync_runs at all.
 *
 * An earlier version of this function used the org_directory_sync_runs
 * table's own partial unique index (tenant_id) WHERE status = 'running' as
 * the lock, with a time-based staleness reclaim for crashed runs. A security
 * review of that approach found a real race: the 30-minute staleness window
 * was a guess, not a fact, so a second caller could steal the lock out from
 * under a sync that was merely slow (a large org, a sluggish Zitadel API),
 * causing two syncs to run concurrently against the same tenant. The
 * advisory lock fixes this at the root: it's held on a single reserved
 * connection for this function's ENTIRE duration (including the external
 * network fetch, which happens outside any DB transaction -- see below), and
 * Postgres releases it automatically the instant that connection closes, so
 * a real crash unblocks immediately with no timeout guess, and a merely-slow
 * sync is never mistaken for a dead one. org_directory_sync_runs remains a
 * plain status/audit table (read by T6's future getSyncStatus), not the lock
 * itself.
 *
 * Atomicity (R2): the tree rebuild (steps ensure-root / upsert / reparent /
 * delete-removed) all happens inside one transaction, so a failure partway
 * leaves the prior tree fully intact. The external network fetch
 * (importer.fetchAll) deliberately happens OUTSIDE any transaction -- holding
 * a DB transaction open across an HTTP round-trip to the identity provider
 * would block a pool connection for the duration of that call. (This is
 * exactly why the advisory lock, not a transaction-scoped one, is required --
 * see acquireTenantAdvisoryLock's own doc comment.)
 *
 * The "prior tree" (R5) is read as the first statement inside that same
 * transaction, before anything is overwritten -- no separate history table.
 *
 * Ordering note (R4's "cycle-break, then reparent, then root-fallback"): this
 * implementation resolves every node's parent (reparent-on-removal / root
 * fallback) in one pass FIRST, then runs cycle detection over the fully
 * resolved graph, rather than the other way round. That's not merely an
 * equivalent reordering -- it's required for correctness. A reparent can
 * itself create a cycle that didn't exist in the fresh pull (e.g. A's fresh
 * manager is B; B's own manager was removed and B's last-known parent was A
 * -- resolving B's reparent target to A produces an A<->B loop only visible
 * after resolution). Running cycle-break strictly before reparenting, as R4's
 * prose literally orders it, would miss this class of cycle. See
 * tree-builder.test.ts's "reparent can introduce a new cycle" case.
