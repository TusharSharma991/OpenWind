/**
 * Regression test for a real production bug (found during a live redeploy,
 * not caught by any mocked unit test): api_keys.oidc_client_id's uniqueness
 * check in apps/api/src/routes/api-keys/create.ts deliberately runs a bare
 * `db.select()` OUTSIDE withTenantContext (it must see across all tenants —
 * a Zitadel Client ID identifies one external application, not one tenant's
 * registration of it). That query still hits api_keys' tenant_read RLS
 * policy, which casts `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` to ::uuid.
 *
 * On a real Postgres backend connection, current_setting(name, true) returns
 * NULL the first time a custom GUC is read — but after ANY prior SET/SET
 * LOCAL on that same connection (even one that already committed/rolled
 * back), it returns '' (empty string), not NULL, since that's the GUC's
 * reset value once initialized. requireAuth() (packages/auth/src/
 * middleware.ts) always runs its own withTenantContext block first on every
 * authenticated request (to upsert tenant_users) — so by the time this
 * route's bare query runs, on postgres-js's reused connection, the RLS
 * policy's cast throws `invalid input syntax for type uuid: ""` instead of
 * safely evaluating to no-match. Fixed in migration 0092 by wrapping the
 * cast in nullif(..., '').
 *
 * Uses a real Postgres database (no mocks) — this class of bug is invisible
 * to a mocked-DB unit test by construction (see create.test.ts, which mocks
 * the DB entirely and never exercises real Postgres GUC semantics).
