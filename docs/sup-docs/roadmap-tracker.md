## Phase 2 — First Customer-Ready Apps

**Goal:** Helpdesk, reimbursements, CRM live for pilot customers. Modules are pure config (seed SQL + UI views only).
**Started:** —
**Target:** Week 9–16 from project start (~2026-06-02 to 2026-06-27)
**Exit test:** Penetration test (tenant isolation) passes before any pilot is onboarded.

## How to update this doc

1. When a GH issue closes → update `Status` to ✅ Done, set `%` to 100, log date in [week-log.md](week-log.md)
2. When a track is partially done → update `%` to estimated progress and add a note
3. When a new sub-item is identified → add a row, create a GH issue, link it
4. Run a session-start check: `gh issue list --state open --label phase:2` to see what's active
