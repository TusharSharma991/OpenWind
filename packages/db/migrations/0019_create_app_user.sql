-- Migration: 0019_create_app_user
-- Creates the app_user role used by withTenantAndUserContext.
-- app_user is a non-superuser, non-bypassrls role — all queries that must
-- be subject to RLS run under this role (set via SET LOCAL ROLE inside a
-- transaction).  Previously app_user was assumed to exist out-of-band;
-- this migration creates it idempotently so CI and fresh installs work.
--
-- DOWN MIGRATION:
-- REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM app_user;
-- REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM app_user;
-- DROP ROLE IF EXISTS app_user;
