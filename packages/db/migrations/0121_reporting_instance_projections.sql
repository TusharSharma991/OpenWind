-- Give reporting the two form values it needs, so the form itself can stop
-- being granted.
--
-- Same defect and same remedy as workflow_events.metadata (0117/0118), applied
-- to the larger table. ADR-001 says analytics_user gets entity_instances "All
-- columns **except `fields`**", because the form payload may hold raw PII.
-- Migration 0113 line 55 granted the table wholesale, which handed `fields`
-- back along with everything added since.
--
-- What reporting actually reads out of the payload, confirmed across every
-- dataset definition — two keys, nothing else:
--
--     fields->>'title'        the ticket title shown in list and detail tiles
--     fields->>'department'   a grouping dimension
--
-- Named `reporting_*` rather than `title`/`department` on purpose. A bare
-- `title` column on this table would imply every entity instance has one, and
-- they do not: `title` is defined on three entity types and `department` on
-- one, both as tenant-configurable form fields. The prefix says what these are
-- — a projection maintained for reporting — and keeps the namespace free for a
-- real column should the platform ever grow one.
--
-- Exact mirrors, deliberately. A friendlier title (COALESCE over
-- 'title'/'subject'/'name' with an id fallback) was considered and left out:
-- it would make the Superset datasets return different rows than they do
-- today, and the whole point is that they return identical ones. Equivalence
-- is verified before the payload grant is withdrawn in 0122.
--
-- Mechanism follows 0117: a nullable column is a catalogue-only change with no
-- table rewrite, where a stored generated column would rewrite this table under
-- an exclusive lock. Virtual generated columns are PostgreSQL 18; this runs 16.
--
-- Rollback (undoes only what THIS migration adds):

--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS set_entity_instance_reporting_projections();
--   ALTER TABLE entity_instances DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS reporting_title;
