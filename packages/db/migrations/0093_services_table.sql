-- ============================================================
-- Migration: 0093_services_table
-- docs/specs/oncall-routing.md T2, R4 -- 3E on-call routing, Phase 1
-- ============================================================
--
-- DOWN MIGRATION (rollback):
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_write" ON "services";
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_read" ON "services";
-- ALTER TABLE "services" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "services_tenant_name_unique";
-- DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "services_team_idx";
-- DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "services_tenant_idx";
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "services";
--
-- analytics: included (id, tenant_id, name, team_id, created_at)
--
-- created_by NOT NULL (PR #583 review, G1) -- same rationale as
-- teams.created_by, see migration 0092's comment.
--
-- team_id has NO foreign key constraint to teams(id) -- cross-tenant
-- ownership of team_id is validated at the application layer (R1d/T44,
-- packages/teams' shared validateCrossTenantRefs helper), not via a DB FK,
-- because a plain FK would only guarantee the team exists somewhere, not
-- that it belongs to the same tenant as this service (Postgres FK checks
-- bypass RLS -- see docs/specs/oncall-routing.md's "cross-tenant FK" row
-- in §C). A DB FK here would also let a soft-deleted team keep being
-- "validly" referenced by Postgres's own integrity check even after the
-- app-layer helper is fixed to exclude soft-deleted rows (see the
-- companion fix in packages/teams/src/cross-tenant-ref-validator.ts) --
-- the app-layer check is the SOLE guard here, deliberately, matching
-- on_call_schedules.team_id's identical no-FK treatment (migration 0094).
--
-- (PR #583 review, blocker 1: an earlier revision of this migration had
-- `REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT` on this column, contradicting
-- this very comment and creating Drizzle schema drift since
-- packages/db/src/schema/teams.ts's teamId column never declared a
-- `.references()` call. Removed -- the comment's stated intent was always
-- correct, the DDL was the bug.)
