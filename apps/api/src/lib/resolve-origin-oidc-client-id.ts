/**
 * docs/specs/third-party-api-origin-tagging.md, Phase 2 (T5/T6). Resolves the
 * stable per-application anchor (api_keys.oidcClientId) for the key that
 * authenticated the current request, given its row id (applicationActorId —
 * parsed from auth.userId's "apikey:<id>" prefix by
 * applicationActorIdFromUserId, NOT the same value: that id is specific to
 * ONE key row and changes on every rotation, oidcClientId does not — see
 * migration 0090's own comment and rotate.ts, which carries oidcClientId
 * forward unchanged on every rotation).
 *
 * Goes through withTenantContext (not the bare `db` client) because api_keys
 * has RLS (tenant_read/tenant_write policies gated on app.tenant_id) and the
 * app connects as the non-superuser `app_user` role in every real deployment
 * — without setting app.tenant_id first, the policy's comparison against
 * NULL means this SELECT always returns zero rows, which made every
 * third-party create request 401 with "Invalid API key" even though the key
 * was valid (found via manual testing against a local AuthNexus-paired fork
 * of this codebase — the bug itself is IdP-agnostic, reproduces identically
 * here). The caller already knows which tenant authenticated this exact
 * request, so this isn't a new cross-tenant enumeration risk — just the same
 * tenant-scoped lookup every other query in this codebase already does.
 *
 * Returns null if the key row is somehow gone by the time this runs (should
 * be unreachable in practice — the key just authenticated this request) so
 * callers fail closed (reject the write) rather than silently tag with a
 * garbage value.
