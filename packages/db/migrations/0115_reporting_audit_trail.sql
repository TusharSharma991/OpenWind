-- Let Superset record what analysts query and export into the platform's own
-- audit store.
--
-- Stage 2 gives people the ability to run their own SQL and pull results out.
-- Superset keeps its own action log, but the spec is explicit that it is not an
-- audit trail: a Superset admin can edit or purge it, and it lives outside the
-- platform's retention and export guarantees
-- (docs/specs/superset-standalone-with-zitadel.md §C "audit trail", R7).
--
-- Two things are needed and neither exists yet.
--
-- 1. The action allowlist. `admin_audit_log.action` is constrained to a fixed
--    set, which is a good property — it keeps the log a closed vocabulary
--    rather than free text — so the reporting actions have to be added to it
--    rather than written around it.
--
-- 2. A way in for the reporting role. That role can read six tables and write
--    none, which is exactly right and leaves it unable to append its own audit
--    record. Rather than granting INSERT on the audit table — which would also
--    let it write records attributed to anyone, about anything — this exposes
--    one function that appends a single row with the action fixed to the
--    reporting vocabulary.
--
-- The function is SECURITY DEFINER so it runs as the owner, with search_path
-- pinned for the same reason as 0114: a definer function resolving names
-- through the caller's search_path can be made to run the caller's code as the
-- owner.
--
-- Rollback (fails if reporting.* rows already exist — delete or keep them
-- first, as with any allowlist narrowing):
--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.record_reporting_audit(uuid, text, text, jsonb);
--   ALTER TABLE admin_audit_log DROP CONSTRAINT audit_log_action_check;
--   -- then re-add the constraint exactly as in 0103.
