/**
 * Posts a system-generated comment ("System Agent") notifying one specific
 * user that something they submitted via the third-party API (an assignedTo
 * value, a comment mention) could not be resolved to a real org member.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling AuthNexus-paired fork's identical fix (2026-09-08).
 * Design: this exists specifically so the API response itself never has to
 * reveal whether an identifier resolved -- the request always succeeds (201,
 * comment/ticket created as submitted), and the *only* place the caller
 * learns "that didn't resolve" is a notification delivered to the one person
 * who submitted it, through the normal in-app/email channel a real reply or
 * mention would use. This turns a free, instant, scriptable oracle (a 422 in
 * the HTTP response, checkable thousands of times a minute) into one that
 * costs a real comment on a real ticket and a real notification per guess --
 * self-limiting and visible in the ticket's own history, not silently
 * probeable.
 *
 * `replyToEventId` should be the id of an existing comment authored by
 * `notifyUserId` -- the reply then rides the existing `comment.replied`
 * notification path (see add-comment.ts), which notifies exactly that
 * comment's own author. When no such comment exists (this tree's third-party
 * ticket/child create schemas have no remark field to seed one from), pass
 * `replyToEventId: undefined` and this posts a top-level comment instead,
 * notifying `notifyUserId` via the existing `comment.mentioned` path -- same
 * notification outcome, no reply target required.
 *
 * `actorId`/`triggeredBy` are the fixed sentinel `"system"` (never a real
 * user id), with `metadata.actorName: "System"` set so the comment
 * timeline renders a fixed label without attempting an org-member lookup.
 * Deliberately NOT "System Agent" or "system" -- ported from the sibling
 * AuthNexus fork's own same-day fix: (1) originally this set
 * originMechanism: "api" / originOidcClientId (copied from the request
 * context that triggered it), which made OriginTag render this internal
 * message as "External · <caller's app>", wrongly attributing an
 * internally-generated notice to the third-party application whose
 * request happened to surface the failure -- fixed by not setting any
 * origin fields at all (a null origin renders no tag, same as any other
 * normal in-app comment). (2) list-workflow-events.ts's snapshot-name
 * dedup guard discards metadata.actorName whenever it exactly equals
 * actorId -- if this were the lowercase "system" sentinel, it would
 * collide with actorId: "system" and render as a truncated "system…";
 * "System" (capitalized) sidesteps that entirely.
