/**
 * audit-hook.ts
 *
 * Lightweight hook mechanism that lets the entity engine fire an audit callback
 * after every create / update / delete mutation — without importing @platform/audit
 * (which would violate the packages/entity-engine → packages/db only dependency rule).
 *
 * Usage (at app startup, in apps/api):
 *
 *   import { registerEntityAuditHook } from "@platform/entity-engine";
 *   import { writeAuditEntry } from "@platform/audit";
 *
 *   registerEntityAuditHook(async (p) => {
 *     await writeAuditEntry(p.db, {
 *       tenantId: p.tenantId,
 *       actorId:  p.actorId,
 *       actorType: p.actorType,
 *       ...
 *     });
 *   });
 *
 * The hook receives the same `db` / `tx` that was passed into the engine function,
 * so the audit INSERT participates in the caller's transaction when present.
 *
 * Errors thrown by the hook propagate to the engine caller — they are NOT silently
 * swallowed. Register a hook that handles its own errors if you need fire-and-forget.
