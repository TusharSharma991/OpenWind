## What is OpenWind?

OpenWind is an open-source, self-hostable business operating platform. It
replaces the patchwork of disconnected SaaS tools that most growing businesses
accumulate — a helpdesk here, an expense system there, a CRM somewhere else —
with a single coherent platform where every module shares the same data layer,
auth, workflow engine, and integration infrastructure.

The core insight behind OpenWind is simple:

> A support ticket, an expense claim, a sales deal, and a purchase order are
> all the same thing — a stateful object moving through a workflow. Once you
> build that engine well, every business process is just configuration on
> top of it.

OpenWind is built for software engineering teams that want to own their
operational stack — either to deploy it internally, extend it for specific
customers, or build sector-specific products on top of it.

---

## The three engines

Everything in OpenWind is powered by three shared engines. Modules, sector
packages, and custom workflows are all configurations of these engines —
not new codebases.

### Entity Engine

Define what your business works with. Contacts, tickets, expenses, assets,
employees — any entity type, with typed fields, relations, and per-tenant
custom fields. No migrations needed when a customer adds a field.

### Workflow Engine

Define how things move. A finite state machine for any entity: states,
transitions, role-based guards, conditional branching, SLA timers with
automatic escalation, and an immutable event log for every transition ever made.

### Automation Engine

Define what happens when things move. An event → condition → action pipeline
that fires on any state change, field update, or external event. Powers
notification routing, assignment rules, cross-system integrations, and
SLA enforcement — all from configuration, no code required.

---

## What's included

### Core platform

Auth and identity (Zitadel), notifications (Novu), file storage (S3-compatible),
audit log, API gateway, background job queue (BullMQ), connector SDK, and plugin
system. Shared by every module — no module reinvents these.

### Standard modules

Pre-built applications that install on top of the engines:

| Module             | What it does                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CRM**            | Contacts, companies, deals, pipeline, activities           |
| **Helpdesk**       | Tickets, SLA, assignments, knowledge base, customer portal |
| **HRMS**           | Employees, org chart, leaves, attendance, onboarding       |
| **Reimbursements** | Expense claims, multi-level approvals, receipt management  |
| **Projects**       | Tasks, milestones, sprints, kanban, time tracking          |
| **Invoicing**      | Invoices, quotes, payment links, recurring billing         |
| **Procurement**    | Purchase orders, vendor management, approval chains        |

### Connectors

First-party integrations: Slack, email (SMTP/IMAP), WhatsApp Business, Stripe,
and more. Third-party connectors installable per tenant from the connector
registry. The connector SDK makes building new integrations a single TypeScript
file.

Multi-tenant from the ground up, using Postgres Row-Level Security. Every
tenant's data is isolated at the database layer — not the application layer.
A developer who forgets a WHERE clause gets only their tenant's rows.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm 9+](https://pnpm.io/installation) (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (running)

### Quick start — one command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TinyPhi/OpenWind.git
cd OpenWind
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script handles everything automatically:

| Step | What it does                                              |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Checks Node.js, pnpm, and Docker versions                 |
| 2    | Creates `.env.local` from `.env.example`                  |
| 3    | Starts all Docker services (`docker compose up -d`)       |
| 4    | Waits for Postgres and Zitadel to be healthy              |
| 5    | Installs all workspace dependencies                       |
| 6    | Runs database migrations and seeds base data              |
| 7    | Configures Zitadel (OIDC app, roles, auth credentials)    |
| 8    | Creates three demo users with different permission levels |
| 9    | Seeds a complete Helpdesk demo with 5 sample tickets      |
| 10   | Prints all URLs and credentials                           |

> **First-run only** — On a fresh install, the script pauses and walks you through generating a Zitadel PAT in about 30 seconds (browser login → copy token → paste). It then saves a service account key to `.env.local` so every subsequent `pnpm bootstrap` is fully headless — no browser step needed.

After bootstrap finishes, everything is already running in Docker. Open `http://localhost:3001` and log in.

To rebuild and restart all containers after code changes:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### What you get

| URL                          | Service                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http://localhost:3001`      | App — admin, agent, and customer views (RBAC-controlled) |
| `http://localhost:3000`      | API                                                      |
| `http://localhost:3000/docs` | API docs (Scalar)                                        |
| `http://localhost:8080`      | Zitadel console                                          |

All user types log in at the same URL (`http://localhost:3001`). The app reads the role from the JWT and shows the appropriate view automatically.

### Demo credentials

| User                     | Password        | Role   | View shown after login |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `owAdmin@openwind.local` | `OpenWind1234!` | Admin  | Full admin panel       |
| `owAgent@openwind.local` | `OpenWind1234!` | Agent  | Agent / support view   |
| `owUser@openwind.local`  | `OpenWind1234!` | User   | Customer / portal view |
| `admin@platform.local`   | `Admin1234!`    | System | Zitadel console only   |

### Seeded demo data

The bootstrap seeds a fully configured **Helpdesk** module so you can explore the platform immediately:

- **Support Ticket** entity type with 6 fields (subject, description, priority, category, customer name, email)
- **Ticket Lifecycle** workflow: New → Open → In Progress → Waiting for Customer → Resolved → Closed
- **5 sample tickets** across every workflow state (from high-priority bugs to feature requests)

### Resetting everything

```bash
docker compose down -v   # removes all container data (volumes wiped)
rm .env.local            # removes your local env + generated credentials
pnpm bootstrap           # full setup from scratch (one PAT step required again)
```

> **Important:** Always use `docker compose down -v` (not just `down`) before re-running bootstrap from scratch. Without `-v`, Docker preserves the Postgres volume and the old Zitadel data will mix with the new setup.

## Roadmap

OpenWind is in active early development. The build is phased:

**Phase 1 — Foundation** _(current)_
Multi-tenant Postgres, auth, entity engine, workflow engine, automation engine
v1, API layer, admin shell.

**Phase 2 — First applications**
Helpdesk, reimbursements, CRM, notification layer, connector v1 (email, Slack),
embedded reporting.

**Phase 3 — Extensibility**
Plugin system, HRMS module, connector marketplace, visual workflow builder,
AI-assisted workflow creation.

**Phase 4 — Sector depth**
Vertical sector packages (healthcare, manufacturing, education, etc.),
white-label support, advanced analytics.

See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the detailed phase breakdown with
milestones and exit criteria.
