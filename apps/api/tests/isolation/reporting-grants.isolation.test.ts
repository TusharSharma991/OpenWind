/**
 * Isolation tests for the reporting role's data surface.
 *
 * These exist because a whole class of reporting bug was invisible to every
 * check that came before them. The reporting path does not run as `app_user`
 * and is not exercised by any handler test: it is a second database role
 * (`analytics_user`) with its own grants, reading through its own connection,
 * scoped by GUCs that Superset's connection mutator stamps. Nothing in the
 * suite touched that role, so three separate PII exposures and one outage all
 * shipped past a green test run.
 *
 * Each test below maps to a defect that actually happened. See
 * docs/specs/reporting-metadata-masking-repair.md §B.
 *
 *   B2  migration 0113 granted `workflow_events` wholesale, restoring the raw
 *       `metadata` payload that 0112 had deliberately withheld
 *   B6  the same for `tenant_users`, which exposed user email addresses
 *   B7  the same for `entity_instances`, exposing the ticket form payload and
 *       the search vector derived from it
 *   B13 the repair for B7 broke 23 of 35 charts: Superset applies a guest
 *       token's row filter to a virtual dataset by rewriting the base table
 *       into `SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE …`, and a wildcard needs table-level
 *       SELECT, which column-level grants cannot satisfy
 *
 * The B13 test is the one to keep honest. It asserts the *shape* Superset
 * generates, not a hand-written column list — writing the columns out is
 * precisely what made every earlier check pass while the dashboard was broken.
 *
 * Runs against a real Postgres instance with a real second connection as
 * `analytics_user`. A mocked database cannot express any of this: the whole
 * subject is grants and row-level security.
