# On-Call Routing & Roster Scheduler

> Smart ticket routing via on-call schedules and severity-driven notification dispatch — assigns primary on-call, tags backup, and escalates via the right channel mix for the ticket's severity.

status: draft

## §G Goal

When an agent doesn't know the right owner, they assign a ticket to a **team** and/or **service**.
The system resolves the current on-call roster entry for that team, assigns the ticket to the
**primary on-call**, and notifies the **backup on-call**. Load distributes across the roster week
over week instead of defaulting to whoever was assigned last or is most available-looking.

Done when:

- Admin can define teams, services, and weekly/monthly on-call rosters
- Ticket creation/update with a team assignment triggers auto-resolve + assign within 5 s
- Ticket severity drives a configurable notification channel mix (email / SMS / WhatsApp / call) scoped to team, dept, and workflow type
- No manual intervention needed once roster and notification policies are configured
- Any ticket without a team assignment or severity is untouched (existing behaviour preserved)

## §C Constraints

| constraint        | value                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| entity engine     | reuse for system field definitions (severity, team_ref, service_ref on ticket type); labels managed outside entity engine via own table + junction                                        |
| automation engine | new action type `resolve_oncall` hooks into the existing rule executor                                                                                                                    |

| channel providers | Novu abstracts providers; specific provider choice (Twilio SMS, Meta WhatsApp, Twilio Voice) is an ops config decision, not a code decision                                               |
| out of scope      | AI-suggested roster generation, multi-timezone auto-DST, SLA-aware escalation paging, external pager integrations (PagerDuty / OpsGenie), notification delivery retries (handled by Novu) |
| custom fields     | entity engine's `addEntityField()` already handles ad-hoc custom fields when `allowCustomFields: true` — no new mechanism needed                                                          |

## §I Interfaces

### New tables (all tenant-scoped, RLS required)

```
teams
  id uuid PK
  tenant_id uuid FK NOT NULL
  name text NOT NULL
  description text
  created_at / updated_at / deleted_at

services
  id uuid PK
  tenant_id uuid FK NOT NULL
  name text NOT NULL
  description text
  team_id uuid FK teams (optional default owner team)
  created_at / updated_at / deleted_at

labels
  id uuid PK
  tenant_id uuid FK NOT NULL
  name text NOT NULL           -- unique per tenant
  color text NOT NULL          -- hex color e.g. '#e11d48' — required for display
  description text             -- optional; shown as tooltip in UI
  created_at / updated_at / deleted_at

ticket_labels (junction — many tickets ↔ many labels)
  ticket_instance_id uuid FK entity_instances NOT NULL
  label_id           uuid FK labels NOT NULL
  tenant_id          uuid FK NOT NULL    -- denormalised for RLS
  assigned_by        uuid FK users NOT NULL
  assigned_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
  PRIMARY KEY (ticket_instance_id, label_id)

on_call_schedules
  id uuid PK
  tenant_id uuid FK NOT NULL
  team_id uuid FK teams NOT NULL
  label text NOT NULL                        -- e.g. "Week 37 2026"
  starts_at timestamptz NOT NULL
  ends_at   timestamptz NOT NULL
  primary_user_id   uuid FK users NOT NULL
  backup_user_id    uuid FK users           -- nullable; optional but recommended
  escalation_manager_user_id uuid FK users  -- nullable
  created_by uuid FK users NOT NULL
  created_at / updated_at / deleted_at   -- soft-delete; preserves audit trail history

  CONSTRAINT no_overlap: EXCLUDE USING gist (tenant_id WITH =, team_id WITH =, tstzrange(starts_at, ends_at) WITH &&)

notification_policies
  id uuid PK
  tenant_id uuid FK NOT NULL
  -- scope dimensions — all nullable; null = "match any value for this dimension"
  team_id          uuid FK teams     (nullable)
  workflow_type_id uuid FK workflows (nullable)  -- matches the workflow type of the ticket
  severity         text NOT NULL CHECK (severity IN ('critical','high','medium','low'))
  -- channels enabled for this policy
  channels         text[] NOT NULL  -- subset of ['email','sms','whatsapp','call']
  -- recipients beyond assignee
  notify_backup    bool NOT NULL DEFAULT true
  notify_escalation_manager bool NOT NULL DEFAULT false  -- auto-true for critical if unset
  created_by uuid FK users NOT NULL
  created_at / updated_at

  UNIQUE per specificity: partial unique indexes so (tenant,team,workflow,severity) has at most
  one row per specificity level — enforced as four partial indexes, not one composite unique
  (because NULL != NULL in composite unique constraints in Postgres)
```

**Policy specificity resolution** (evaluated at notification dispatch time, highest score wins):

| team_id set | workflow_type_id set | specificity score |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| ✓           | ✓                    | 3 — most specific |
| ✓           | ✗                    | 2                 |
| ✗           | ✓                    | 1                 |
| ✗           | ✗                    | 0 — global        |

If no policy matches, system falls back to `email` only (hardcoded safe default).
Multiple policies at the same score are an error at write time (`409`).

### New entity fields (added to the `ticket` entity type as system fields)

| field name   | type         | values / notes                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `severity`   | `select`     | `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low` |
| `team_id`    | `entity_ref` | references `teams` table               |
| `service_id` | `entity_ref` | references `services` table            |

Labels are not an entity engine field — they are managed via the `labels` + `ticket_labels`
tables and exposed through dedicated endpoints (`/admin/labels`, `/tickets/:id/labels`).
This gives colored, named, tenant-managed labels with proper many-to-many assignment.

Custom ad-hoc fields continue via the existing `addEntityField()` path — nothing new required.

### New automation action types

```
resolve_oncall
  input:  team_id field path on the triggering entity
  effect:
    1. query on_call_schedules WHERE team_id = <resolved>
                                AND tenant_id = <ticket tenant>
                                AND starts_at <= now() AND ends_at > now()
                                LIMIT 1
    2. set entity.assignee = primary_user_id
    3. if backup_user_id: add to entity watchers / send notification
    4. write audit entry (action: "oncall.auto_assigned")
  fail-safe: if no active schedule found → leave assignee unchanged,
             emit warning log, write audit entry (action: "oncall.no_schedule")

dispatch_severity_notification
  input:  severity field value + team_id + workflow_type_id from the triggering entity
  effect:
    1. resolve notification policy (specificity score, highest wins; fallback = email only)
    2. build recipient list:
         - always: ticket assignee
         - if notify_backup: backup on-call from current on_call_schedules entry
         - if notify_escalation_manager (or severity='critical'): escalation manager from current schedule
    3. for each channel in policy.channels:
         email     → send via Novu email channel
         sms       → send via Novu SMS channel (provider: Twilio or equiv.)
         whatsapp  → send via Novu WhatsApp channel
         call      → trigger Novu voice/call channel (provider: Twilio Voice or equiv.)
    4. write audit entry (action: "notification.dispatched", metadata: {channels, recipientCount, policyId})
  fail-safe: channel dispatch failures do not roll back the ticket mutation;
             each channel failure is logged independently + written to audit as "notification.channel_failed"
```

### REST API surface (admin-only writes; agent read-only)

```
GET    /admin/teams                      list teams (paginated, cursor-based)
POST   /admin/teams                      create
PATCH  /admin/teams/:id                  update
DELETE /admin/teams/:id                  soft-delete

GET    /admin/services                   list services (paginated)
POST   /admin/services                   create
PATCH  /admin/services/:id               update
DELETE /admin/services/:id               soft-delete

GET    /admin/on-call-schedules          list schedules (filter: team_id, from, to)
POST   /admin/on-call-schedules          create schedule entry
PATCH  /admin/on-call-schedules/:id      update — only permitted if starts_at > now() (future window); editing an already-started or past window returns 422
DELETE /admin/on-call-schedules/:id      soft-delete (deleted_at set; entry preserved for audit trail and historical on-call lookups)

GET    /admin/on-call-schedules/current  active on-call per team right now (UI dashboard)

GET    /admin/notification-policies               list all policies (filter: team_id, workflow_type_id, severity)
POST   /admin/notification-policies               create policy (409 if same specificity slot already taken)
PATCH  /admin/notification-policies/:id           update channels / recipients
DELETE /admin/notification-policies/:id           delete (falls back to next-lower-specificity policy)

GET    /admin/notification-policies/resolve        dry-run resolver — given ?team_id=&workflow_type_id=&severity=
                                                   returns the policy that would be applied + effective channel list
                                                   (used by UI "preview" before saving)

GET    /admin/labels                              list tenant labels (paginated, cursor-based)
POST   /admin/labels                              create label (name + color required)
PATCH  /admin/labels/:id                          update name / color / description
DELETE /admin/labels/:id                          soft-delete (clears from future assignments; existing ticket_labels rows kept for history)

GET    /tickets/:id/labels                        list labels on a ticket
PUT    /tickets/:id/labels                        replace full label set (array of label IDs)
POST   /tickets/:id/labels/:labelId               add a single label to a ticket
DELETE /tickets/:id/labels/:labelId               remove a single label from a ticket
```

## §R Requirements

### Ticket fields

R1: Ticket entity type ships three new system fields — `severity`, `team_id`, `service_id`.
✓ Creating a ticket with `severity: "critical"` stores and returns "critical"
✓ Creating with an unrecognised severity value returns `422` with a field-level error
✓ `team_id` references a valid `teams` row in the same tenant; cross-tenant ref returns `422`
✓ `service_id` references a valid `services` row in the same tenant; cross-tenant ref returns `422`
✓ All three fields are optional — tickets without them behave exactly as before (no regression)

R1b: Admins can manage a tenant-scoped label vocabulary — create, rename, recolor, and soft-delete labels.
✓ `POST /admin/labels {name, color}` → `201`; `GET /admin/labels` lists it with color chip
✓ `color` is required and must be a valid 6-digit hex string (e.g. `#e11d48`); invalid format → `422`
✓ Duplicate name within a tenant returns `409`
✓ Soft-deleting a label removes it from the label picker in the ticket form; existing ticket_labels rows are kept (history preserved)
✓ Only `admin` role can create, update, or delete labels; `agent` role gets read-only (`GET /admin/labels → 200`, write → `403`)

R1c: Agents and admins can apply and remove labels on individual tickets; tickets are filterable by label.
✓ `POST /tickets/:id/labels/:labelId` → `200`; label appears in `GET /tickets/:id/labels` response
✓ `DELETE /tickets/:id/labels/:labelId` → `204`; label no longer in response
✓ `PUT /tickets/:id/labels` with an array of label IDs replaces the full label set atomically
✓ Assigning a label from a different tenant returns `422` (cross-tenant guard)
✓ Label assignment and removal are written to `admin_audit_log` (`label.assigned`, `label.removed`)
✓ `GET /tickets?label_id=X` returns only tickets carrying label X within the same tenant

R2: System ticket fields cannot be removed or redefined via the custom-field API.
✓ `removeEntityField("severity")` on a ticket type returns a `400` or is blocked at the schema level
✓ `addEntityField` with the same name as a system field returns `409`

### Teams & Services registry

R3: Admins can create, list, update, and soft-delete teams within their tenant.
✓ `POST /admin/teams` returns `201` with the new team; `GET /admin/teams` lists it
✓ Soft-deleting a team hides it from listing but preserves FK integrity on existing schedules/tickets
✓ Duplicate name within a tenant returns `409`

R4: Admins can create, list, update, and soft-delete services; each service may belong to a team.
✓ Same CRUD behaviour as teams
✓ `GET /admin/services` resolves the owning team name inline
✓ Deleting a team does not cascade-delete its services (FK constraint + `409` or `400` if services exist)

### Roster scheduler

R5: Admins define on-call schedule entries covering a team, a time window, and named on-call roles.
✓ Overlapping window for the same team + tenant returns `409`
✓ `starts_at >= ends_at` returns `422`
✓ `primary_user_id` must belong to the same tenant; foreign user returns `422`
✓ A schedule entry spanning Mon–Sun 00:00 UTC is stored and returned with those exact timestamps

R6: Current on-call snapshot returns the active schedule per team as of `now()`.
✓ `GET /admin/on-call-schedules/current` returns one entry per team with an active schedule
✓ Teams with no active schedule appear with `oncall: null` — not omitted
✓ Response includes resolved display names for primary, backup, escalation manager

R7: Schedule listing allows filtering by team and date range.
✓ `GET /admin/on-call-schedules?team_id=X&from=T1&to=T2` returns entries sorted by `starts_at`
✓ No entries in range → empty array `[]`, not `404`

### Auto-assignment

R8: Setting `team_id` on a ticket (create or update) triggers on-call resolution and auto-assigns the ticket.
✓ Ticket created with `team_id` → within 5 s, `assignee` is the primary on-call user
✓ Ticket updated to add/change `team_id` → same auto-assign fires; previous assignee is replaced
✓ Backup on-call receives a notification that they are tagged on the ticket
✓ Both auto-assign and backup tagging appear in the audit log

R9: No active schedule for the team → ticket left unchanged, warning surfaced.
✓ `assignee` remains unchanged (null if new ticket, prior value if update)
✓ Audit log records `oncall.no_schedule` for the team at that timestamp
✓ Admin UI surfaces affected tickets (has `team_id`, no `assignee`) with a coverage-gap badge

R8b: On-call resolution cascades primary → backup → escalation manager, skipping any tier whose
user is deactivated/deleted; if all three tiers are unavailable, the same fail-open coverage-gap
behavior as R9 applies (ticket left unchanged, `oncall.no_schedule` audited) rather than a
distinct failure path.
✓ Primary on-call user is deactivated → backup on-call is assigned instead; audit records which
tier the assignment actually resolved at (`oncall.auto_assigned` with `assignedTier: "backup"`)
✓ Primary and backup both deactivated → escalation manager is assigned (`assignedTier: "escalation"`)
✓ All three tiers deactivated or the schedule entry itself is missing them → same R9 fail-open path:
`assignee` unchanged, `oncall.no_schedule` audited (not a new/different action string) — the
spec makes no behavioral distinction between "no schedule exists" and "schedule exists but every
tier is unavailable"; both are coverage gaps
✓ "Deactivated/deleted user" reuses the same active-user check used by the temporal-scheduler's
stale-owner detection (see `temporal-scheduler.md` R-stale-owner) — factored as one shared
helper rather than duplicated per track, same spirit as the T44 cross-tenant FK helper

R10: Explicit `assignee` on the same request as `team_id` wins; auto-resolution is skipped.
✓ Ticket with both `team_id` and explicit `assignee` in same payload → explicit assignee is used
✓ Audit log records `oncall.skipped_explicit_assignee` (not `oncall.auto_assigned`)

R11: Auto-assignment is idempotent — replaying the same trigger event does not duplicate assignments or audit entries.
✓ Re-delivering the same `entity.updated` event for the same ticket version results in same assignee with no duplicate audit rows

### Security & isolation

R12: All new tables are tenant-scoped; cross-tenant data is never accessible.
✓ Isolation tests: querying teams / services / schedules as Tenant B returns `[]` when only Tenant A has data
✓ `resolve_oncall` action resolves schedules only within the triggering ticket's tenant

R13: Only `admin` role can write teams, services, and schedules; agents get read-only.
✓ `agent` role `POST /admin/teams` → `403`
✓ `agent` role `GET /admin/teams` → `200` (needed for ticket-form dropdowns)

### Severity-based notification routing

R14: Admins configure notification policies mapping (severity × optional team × optional workflow type) → channel list.
✓ `POST /admin/notification-policies` with `{severity:"high", channels:["email","sms"]}` (no team, no workflow) creates a global policy
✓ Same call with `team_id` set creates a team-scoped policy at higher specificity
✓ Two policies at identical specificity (same severity + same team_id + same workflow_type_id) return `409`
✓ `channels` must be a non-empty subset of `["email","sms","whatsapp","call"]`; invalid channel name returns `422`

R15: Policy specificity resolution — most specific matching policy wins; global policy is fallback; email-only is hardcoded last resort.
✓ Ticket with team_id=A, workflow_type_id=W, severity=high: if a policy exists for (team=A, workflow=W, severity=high) it wins over (team=A, severity=high)
✓ Ticket with no team_id: team-scoped policies are skipped; workflow or global policy applies
✓ Ticket with severity=low and no matching policy at any level: only email is dispatched (hardcoded fallback)
✓ `GET /admin/notification-policies/resolve?team_id=A&severity=high` returns the resolved policy + effective channel list without sending anything

R16: When a ticket's severity is set or changed, notification dispatch fires using the resolved policy for that ticket.
✓ Ticket created with `severity: "critical"` → all channels in the matching critical policy fire within 10 s
✓ Ticket updated from `severity: "low"` to `severity: "high"` → high policy fires; low policy does NOT re-fire
✓ Severity unchanged on update → no re-dispatch
✓ Ticket with severity but no team_id or workflow_type_id → global policy for that severity applies

R17: Recipient set is resolved from the on-call schedule at dispatch time, not at ticket creation.
✓ If primary on-call changes between ticket creation and notification dispatch, the notification goes to the on-call person at dispatch time
✓ Assignee always receives notification regardless of policy (they are always in the recipient list)
✓ Backup on-call receives notification only when `notify_backup: true` on the resolved policy
✓ Escalation manager receives notification when `notify_escalation_manager: true` OR when severity = "critical" (implicit)

R18: Per-channel dispatch failures are isolated — one failed channel does not suppress the others.
✓ If SMS delivery fails but email succeeds: email is delivered; SMS failure is logged + audited as `notification.channel_failed`
✓ Ticket mutation is never rolled back due to a notification failure
✓ Admin UI surfaces recent `notification.channel_failed` entries per ticket (last 24 h)

R19: Only `admin` role can write notification policies; agents and customers cannot.
✓ `agent` role `POST /admin/notification-policies` → `403`
✓ Notification policies are tenant-scoped; isolation test: Tenant B policy never affects Tenant A dispatch

R20: The dry-run resolver endpoint returns the effective policy without side effects.
✓ `GET /admin/notification-policies/resolve?severity=critical&team_id=X` returns `{policyId, channels, recipients: [...], matchedAt: "team+severity"}` — no notification sent, no audit entry written

---

## §V Invariants

- Schedule entries never overlap for the same (tenant, team) pair — enforced at DB level via GIST exclusion constraint, not application-layer alone
- `resolve_oncall` is fail-open: lookup failure leaves ticket unchanged, never assigns to a wrong user
- Cross-tenant user references in schedule entries are rejected at write time, not silently stored
- System ticket fields (`severity`, `team_id`, `service_id`) survive a schema cache invalidation cycle without data loss
- Cross-tenant label assignment is rejected at write time (`422`); `ticket_labels.tenant_id` is always the ticket's tenant, never the label assigner's caller tenant
- Soft-deleting a label never deletes historical `ticket_labels` rows — `ticket_labels` rows are hard-deleted only on explicit label removal (`DELETE /tickets/:id/labels/:labelId`); label assignment history is preserved via the audit log's `label.removed` entries
- Auto-assignment audit entries are written in the same DB transaction as the assignment; rolled-back assignments produce no dangling audit entries
- `team_id` field on a ticket is always validated against the same tenant's `teams` table (entity engine cross-tenant-reference guard already covers `entity_ref` fields)
- Notification dispatch is always decoupled from ticket mutation: a notification failure never rolls back the ticket write
- Severity re-dispatch fires only when the severity field value changes, not on every ticket update — prevents notification storms on unrelated edits
- Policy specificity is computed at dispatch time from live DB state, never cached — a policy change takes effect on the next severity-change event, not the next cache refresh
- A `notification.dispatched` audit entry is written per dispatch attempt, one `notification.channel_failed` per failed channel — never swallowed silently
- No policy at any specificity level = email-only; no severity on the ticket = no notification dispatch at all
- The assignee set by `resolve_oncall` reflects the primary/backup/escalation user resolved by the cascade at schedule-lookup time, not guaranteed-current at commit time — accepted TOCTOU trade-off; schedule changes are infrequent admin operations
- The primary→backup→escalation cascade (R8b) and the exhausted-cascade fail-open path share the identical `oncall.no_schedule` audit action and coverage-gap UI treatment as the no-schedule-at-all case (R9) — there is deliberately no separate "cascade exhausted" action string
- Provider error messages written to `admin_audit_log` or logs must be sanitized: raw `err.message` is never stored; only error code + masked, truncated provider message (E.164 numbers masked) is written
- On-call schedule entries are soft-deleted (`deleted_at`), never hard-deleted — audit entries referencing a `scheduleId` remain resolvable after admin deletion
- A schedule entry whose window has already started (`starts_at <= now()`) cannot be modified via PATCH — returns `422`; only future-window entries are editable
