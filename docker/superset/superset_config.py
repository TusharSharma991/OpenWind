# ─── Tenant isolation ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This is the whole tenancy boundary for reporting. Read it before changing it.
#
# The platform's own isolation is Postgres row-level security, keyed on a
# per-connection setting: every policy is
# `tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::uuid`, and the API sets
# that setting per request. Superset does not do that, which is what made
# reporting isolation an open question — a shared reporting connection with no
# setting would see either nothing or everything, depending on the role.
#
# DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR closes it. Superset calls this hook while building the
# connection for a query, and hands it the identity of whoever asked. We stamp
# that identity onto the connection as `app.tenant_id`, so the platform's
# EXISTING RLS policies apply to Superset exactly as they apply to the API. No
# new views, no second isolation mechanism to keep in sync with the first.
#
# Two properties make this safe, both verified against this image's source
# rather than assumed:
#
#  1. No connection is reused across tenants. `get_sqla_engine_with_context()`
#     takes `nullpool: bool = True` by default, so NullPool is used: a fresh
#     physical connection per query, closed after. A stamped connection cannot
#     be handed to a different tenant's request later.
#  2. The identity is available without enabling impersonation.
#     `get_effective_user()` consults `get_username()` — i.e. `g.user.username`,
#     which for an embedded request is the `user.username` field of the guest
#     token our mint endpoint issues — before it ever looks at
#     `impersonate_user`.
#
# Fails closed. If the identity is absent or not a tenant id (an admin browsing
# Superset directly, say), the setting is left unset. `current_setting(...,
# true)` then returns NULL, every RLS policy evaluates false, and the query
# returns no rows. The failure mode is an empty dashboard, never another
# tenant's data.
# Subject ids reach a connection string, so only characters that cannot
# terminate an option or start another are permitted. Zitadel issues numeric
# subjects; the wider set matches what the API already accepts as a principal.

# choice (apps/admin-ui/src/pages/reporting.tsx) so the panel follows the
# app's own toggle instead of keeping its own.
