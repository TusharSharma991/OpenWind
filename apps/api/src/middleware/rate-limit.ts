/**
 * Pre-auth flood guard — runs before requireAuth() has verified anything, so
 * the ONLY safe identity to key on is the transport-level client IP. This
 * used to also try decoding (not verifying) a bearer token's claims, which
 * let a client evade its bucket entirely by varying an unverified claim per
 * request (#195) — requireAuth() (@platform/auth) now runs a second,
 * tenant-scoped check on the *verified* auth.tenantId after authentication,
 * which is the layer that actually needs to be unforgeable.
 *
 * Neither x-forwarded-for nor x-real-ip is set by anything in local dev (no
 * reverse proxy in front of the API there — see docs/local-setup.md), and a
 * misconfigured prod proxy that drops or overwrites these headers hits the
 * same gap. Previously that fell back to the literal string "unknown" for
 * every request with neither header — a single shared bucket across every
 * client, in every environment, which is the actual cause of "random" 429s
 * reported even with a single developer/browser in local dev (a handful of
 * concurrent requests on one page load can exhaust the 10/min auth-route
 * budget by itself). Falling back to the raw TCP peer address instead scopes
 * that failure mode to "one bucket per direct connection" rather than "one
 * bucket, period" — still collapsed if a reverse proxy multiplexes many
 * real clients over one connection to us without setting either header, but
 * that misconfiguration should be fixed at the proxy, not papered over here.
