# CLAUDE.md — Platform Engineering Context

Loaded automatically at the start of every session.
Detailed rules live in `.claude/rules/` and auto-load — see the index below.

## What we are building

A modular, workflow-native business platform. Every module (CRM, helpdesk, HRMS,
reimbursements, etc.) is a configuration of three shared engines: Entity Engine,
Workflow Engine, Automation Engine. Modules are seed SQL + one-line stub index files —
no domain logic TypeScript in `modules/`.

Reference docs (read before starting work in a new area):

- `docs/architecture-brief.md` — full platform architecture
- `docs/decisions/ADR-001-multitenancy.md` — tenancy model and RLS
- `docs/decisions/ADR-002-workflow-engine.md` — state machine design
- `docs/decisions/ADR-003-field-validation.md` — entity validation
- `docs/sup-docs/roadmap-tracker.md` — phase progress and track status
- `docs/sup-docs/week-log.md` — running velocity log (update each session)

## Current focus

**Phase:** 3 — Scale & Extensibility (not started — planning required before 3A)
**Phase 2 status:** ✅ Complete as of 2026-06-18 (all 4 tracks + pre-pilot hardening merged)

Phase 3 tracks (all 0% — no active work yet):

| ID    | Track                                               | Notes                                                                                              |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3A    | Integration layer — connector runtime, marketplace  | Next. Requires human planning sign-off. Write `.claude/context/phase-3-primer.md` before starting. |
| 3B    | Plugin system — Module Federation, slot registry    | After 3A                                                                                           |
| 3C    | AI layer — automation gen, workflow suggestion, RAG | After 3B                                                                                           |
| 3D    | Observability + compliance — OTel, Prometheus, GDPR | Parallel with 3A–3C possible                                                                       |
| 3-OPS | Deferred ops/infra concerns                         | See Phase 1 carry-overs in tracker                                                                 |

**Pre-Phase 3 hardening (external review flagged — complete before starting 3A):**

These are not Phase 3 features — they are correctness/safety fixes in existing code.
Work in this order (sequential dependencies at the top):

- [ ] [#121](../../issues/121) RLS under real role: `withTenantContext` sets `app.tenant_id` GUC but never `SET LOCAL ROLE app_user`. Add `SET LOCAL ROLE app_user` or `ALTER TABLE … FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` so RLS is enforced regardless of connection role.
- [ ] [#122](../../issues/122) Isolation tests skipped: the three cross-tenant RLS tests are `.skip` because CI runs as superuser. Run CI isolation suite as `app_user` so the isolation guarantee is actually proven. (depends on #121)
- [ ] [#120](../../issues/120) Automation double-trigger: `transition` action writes outbox + calls inline, depth resets to 0 on outbox path → `MAX_DEPTH` never fires in loops. Fix: carry `depth` through outbox payload or deduplicate by idempotency key.
- [ ] [#123](../../issues/123) Automation queue retries: `automation` BullMQ queue has `attempts=1` (BullMQ default). Add `attempts: 3, backoff: { type: "exponential" }` to match the SLA queue.
- [ ] [#124](../../issues/124) Auth middleware write-on-every-request: `packages/auth/src/middleware.ts:154-169` does `onConflictDoUpdate` (not `onConflictDoNothing`) on every authenticated request — HOT update per request at scale.
- [ ] [#125](../../issues/125) `notify` action is a stub: `actions/notify.ts` only logs. Wire Novu delivery worker to close the notification loop.
- [ ] [#126](../../issues/126) `entity.created` / `entity.assigned` triggers never fire: defined in `event-schemas.ts` but entity engine never emits them to the outbox.
- [ ] [#127](../../issues/127) `setEntityState` / `bulkSetState` are unguarded state side-doors: mutate `current_state` directly with no `workflow_events` row and no outbox event.
- [ ] [#128](../../issues/128) OpenBao + MinIO commented out of `docker-compose.yml`: the code expects them but `docker compose up` doesn't start them. Uncomment and reconcile with `.env.example`.
- [ ] [#129](../../issues/129) Worker has no health endpoint: orchestrators cannot health-check `apps/worker`. Add an HTTP readiness probe.

**Off-limits (never touch autonomously):**

- Parallel approval code — deferred to Phase 3
- ADR files in `docs/decisions/` — humans write these
- Schema cache / `redis.keys()` fix — deferred until load testing

## Dependency rule (enforced by ESLint — CI fails on violations)

```
apps/*             → packages/*
modules/*          → packages/*   (no cross-module imports ever)
entity-engine      → db only
workflow-engine    → db, entity-engine
automation-engine  → db, workflow-engine, entity-engine
```

Cross-module communication: event bus, entity engine relations API, or tRPC only.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # start all services with hot reload
pnpm test             # unit + integration tests
pnpm test:isolation   # RLS isolation tests  (requires Docker/OrbStack stack)
pnpm test:e2e         # end-to-end API tests (requires Docker/OrbStack stack)
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check all packages
pnpm lint             # ESLint, max-warnings=0
pnpm db:migrate       # run pending migrations
pnpm db:seed          # seed development data
docker compose up -d  # start Postgres, Redis, MinIO, OpenBao, Zitadel, Novu
```

macOS: use OrbStack (not Docker Desktop). Windows: run isolation/e2e in CI or WSL2.

## When stuck

1. Check the relevant ADR in `docs/decisions/` — the decision and reasoning are there
2. Check existing tests — they document expected behavior precisely
3. Check `.claude/context/` for domain-specific guides (entity-engine.md, workflow-engine.md, automation-engine.md)
4. Check `docs/sup-docs/roadmap-tracker.md` — understand the phase context before changing scope
5. If a decision isn't covered by an ADR, write one before implementing

---

## Maintenance notes

**Dep bumps:** The `pnpm.overrides.esbuild` pin (`>=0.28.1`) is for GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr
(esbuild < 0.28.1, high severity). Do not remove it — tsx@4.x and vite@6.x both pull in the
vulnerable version transitively.
