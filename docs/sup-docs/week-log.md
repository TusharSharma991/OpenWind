# Week-over-Week Progress Log

**Format:** One entry per session or per milestone close. Newest at top.
**Purpose:** Running velocity record for an AI-first dev team. Update this at the start/end of each work session.

**Note:** entries from 2026-08-06 down through 2026-08-03 (PRs #316–#345) were reconstructed
retroactively on 2026-08-07 from `gh pr`/`gh issue` state — this log went 4 days unupdated across
~20 merged PRs. Dates reflect actual merge time, not when this entry was written; verification
detail (typecheck/lint/test pass state) is only included where a PR's own body recorded it.

## 2026-08-17 — live re-verification of ui-feature-checklist-and-rules.md finds 2 more bugs

**Session type:** Full live re-verification (real Postgres/Redis, not mocked unit tests) of
every notification/history rule, prompted by a user report that 2026-08-14's "✅ Implemented"
claim for the access-level-change notification (§2.3) was wrong on first live click-through.
**Found and fixed 2 more real, previously-undetected bugs:**

1. **`notifications_type_check` was also missing `entity.unassigned`** (migration
   `0061_notifications_entity_unassigned_type.sql`) — same bug class as 0060, one type missed
   on the first pass.
2. **`packages/automation-engine/src/event-schemas.ts` required `.uuid()` on identity-provider
   user-id fields** (`entity.assigned`'s `assigneeId`/`assignedBy`, `entity.unassigned`'s
   `previousAssigneeId`/`actorId`, `entity.created`'s `createdBy`, `workflow.transitioned`'s
   `actorId`) — AuthNexus issues numeric-string ids, not UUIDs, so every real event of these
   types threw `INVALID_EVENT_PAYLOAD` and dead-lettered, meaning any automation rule
   triggering on assignment/unassignment/creation/transition has silently never fired since
   this branch's inception. Predates this session; only surfaced once 0060/0061 let the
   _notification_ path succeed far enough to reveal the automation-side failure underneath.
   Fixed by relaxing to `z.string().min(1)`, matching the precedent in
   `entity-engine/src/validation/schema-builder.ts`'s `user_ref` comment. New test file
   `packages/automation-engine/src/event-schemas.test.ts`.
   **Verified live, one action at a time, watching `aw-worker`/`aw-backend` logs:** reassignment
   (`entity.assigned`+`entity.unassigned`), state transition (`workflow.transitioned`), field edit
   (`entity.updated`), access request submit+approve (`access_request.created`/`.updated` +
   `access.granted`), file download (`file_downloaded` history event) — all confirmed inserting
   and delivering, zero new dead-letters after both fixes.
   **Lesson:** "tests pass" and "verified against a real database" are different claims — a CHECK
   constraint or an overly strict Zod `.uuid()` on a non-UUID identity provider are both invisible
   to unit tests that mock the DB/never construct a real cross-service payload.

## 2026-08-14 — fix `notifications_type_check` blocking 6 already-wired notification event types

**Session type:** Bug report → root cause → fix, verified live end-to-end
**Summary:** `notification-poller.ts`'s `NOTIFICATION_EVENT_TYPES` allowlist and
`notification-recipients.ts`/`notification-templates.ts` already handled `access.updated`,
`workflow.transitioned`, `entity.updated`, `entity.due_date_approaching`,
`access_request.created`, and `access_request.updated` — all correctly, per their own unit
tests. But the `notifications` table's own `notifications_type_check` CHECK constraint was
never extended to match, so every INSERT for these 6 types silently failed at the DB layer and
landed in `dead_letter_events`, even though the outbox event, recipient resolution, and template
build all succeeded. Caught via live user testing against
`ui-feature-checklist-and-rules.md` (an access-level change produced no in-app notification
despite the code path looking correct) and root-caused by watching `aw-worker` logs
(`"Notification: job moved to dead letter queue"`) and querying `dead_letter_events` directly.
**Fix:** migration `0060_notifications_type_check_missing_types.sql` drops and recreates the
constraint with all 6 types added (16 total). Verified live post-migration: `access.updated`
now inserts successfully (previously 0 successful rows, confirmed via direct `psql` query).
**Lesson:** a Postgres CHECK constraint enum is a silent failure mode that unit tests with a
mocked DB layer cannot catch — any new `notifications.type` value needs both the TS-side
allowlist/resolver/template AND this constraint updated in the same change.

## 2026-08-10 — fix workflow-admin assignment 404 for org members who haven't logged in

**Session type:** Bug report → fix, reproduced on both local and prod
**Summary:** `PATCH /workflows/:id` rejected valid `assignedTo` (workflow-admin) user ids with
`404 "One or more users not found in this tenant"`, even for real, currently-picked AuthNexus
org members. Root cause: the workflow-admin picker (`apps/admin-ui/.../workflows/detail.tsx`)
sources candidates from `GET /users`, which deliberately surfaces every AuthNexus org member
regardless of local login history (by design — it also feeds the @mention picker, so customers
can be mentioned before their first login). But `update.ts`'s validation checked candidates
against `tenant_users`, a table that only gets a row for someone on their _first login_
(`packages/auth/src/middleware.ts`). Any org member who hadn't personally logged into the app
yet would always be offered by the picker and always rejected by the write — reproduced
identically on the hosting server, not a local-data artifact.
**Fix:** `update.ts` now validates `assignedTo` against AuthNexus org membership directly via
`listOrgUsers` — the exact same call `GET /users` already uses — instead of the local
`tenant_users` cache. Added a diagnostic warning log for the case where `listOrgUsers` returns
zero users (which could mean a genuinely empty org, or `listOrgUsers` silently swallowing an
AuthNexus fetch failure into `[]` — a pre-existing, shared ambiguity in that function used by
several other callers too; not changing its contract here, just making the ambiguity visible
at this call site rather than silently misreading an outage as "users don't exist").
**Known dev-only limitation (documented, not fixed):** `DEV_TENANT_ID`'s local-dev override
maps every login to one seeded tenant while `orgId` stays the real AuthNexus org id, so a
fixture/seed-only user (never a real AuthNexus org member) can no longer be assigned as a
workflow admin in local dev — only affects fake fixture data locally; production has no
`DEV_TENANT_ID` fallback so this doesn't apply there.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint` PASS; `update.test.ts` rewritten for the new
AuthNexus-based check (7/7 pass, including a new test for the exact previously-broken case —
assigning an org member with zero local login history — and a test asserting the diagnostic
warning fires). Rebuilt and restarted local `ow-backend`; manually confirmed the exact reported
case now succeeds (assigned a real org member with no `tenant_users` row as a workflow admin).
One round of adversarial `/review` — two findings, both addressed (see above).

## 2026-08-10 — deployed outbox RLS + outbound-notification fixes to hosting server

**Session type:** Deploy, follow-up to the two hotfix commits above (`1d06256`, `df927d6`)
**Summary:** Deployed both commits to the AuthNexus hosting server (`rokka-virtual-machine`).
`git pull` alone was insufficient — the server runs prebuilt Docker images, not
source-mounted/tsx-hot-reload containers, so `docker compose restart ow-worker ow-backend`
picked up the pull but kept running the old baked-in code; confirmed via logs still showing the
exact pre-fix RLS failure after the restart. Required `docker compose build ow-worker
ow-backend` (rebuild, not restart) before the fix actually took effect — worth remembering for
any future server deploy in this repo, not just this one.
**Verification:** post-rebuild logs show clean `Notification poller: delivered events to
queue` / `Notification: in-app delivery complete` for a real `comment.mentioned` event, no RLS
errors. A live end-to-end test (real @mention via the UI) confirmed **both** in-app
notification and email delivered successfully on the server — meaning the AuthNexus
service-account 403/401 seen during local testing was local-only (a different/stale credential
setup for the local test org), not a problem with the server's actual configured credentials.
No AuthNexus admin action needed after all; that open item from the two hotfix entries above is
resolved.
**Still open (unrelated to this deploy):** the workflow-detail 404 gap documented in
`C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tushar\OFF\work docs\tushar-branch-pull-outbox-rls-fix.md`'s "Known
issue" section — not fixed, not deployed, no decision made yet on approach.

## 2026-08-10 — fix outbound-notification dead-letter write missing tenant context

**Session type:** Follow-up hotfix, same incident family as the outbox-sweeper fix above
**Summary:** While verifying the outbox-sweeper fix locally (rebuilt `ow-backend`/`ow-worker`,
tested login + a mention), found emails still weren't sending. Server/local logs showed two
separate things: (1) the actual outbound handoff failing with `401` from the outbound delivery
service and `403` from an AuthNexus service-account token exchange — both external
credential/config issues on the AuthNexus/Novu side, not this repo's code (org/project IDs
verified correctly configured; needs someone with AuthNexus admin access to check the
`openwind-api-bot`/`novu-outbound-caller` machine users); and (2) a real code bug:
`notification-outbound-worker.ts`'s `handleFailedJob` recorded that permanent failure via a
bare `db.insert(outboxEvents)` with no tenant context, so _that_ insert also failed with the
same `invalid input syntax for type uuid` RLS error as the sweeper bug — meaning even the "notify
admins that email delivery is broken" fallback was silently broken. Its own comment claimed
"RLS disabled by design" citing `0006_remove_internal_table_rls.sql`, which was true until
`0050_outbox_events_rls.sql` re-enabled RLS on this table and was never updated.
**Fix:** wrapped the insert in `withTenantContext(tenantId, ...)`, matching every other
tenant-scoped outbox write in the codebase (`av-scan.ts`, `due-date-worker.ts`,
`sla-breacher.ts`) — not `setOutboxSweeperRole`, which is reserved for genuinely cross-tenant
sweeps. Removed the now-unused `db` import; updated the existing unit test's `@platform/db` mock
to route `insert` through the same `tx` mock `withTenantContext` already uses.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint` PASS, `pnpm --filter @platform/worker test` PASS
(133/133). Four independent adversarial `/review` passes (reuse/simplification/efficiency/
altitude, removed-behavior audit, cross-file trace, line-by-line scan) — no correctness issues.
One pass raised `engine.ts`/`child-relations.ts`'s plain `db.insert(outboxEvents)` as
potentially the same bug class; verified false positive — `db` there is a `DbOrTx` _parameter_
shadowing the import, receiving an already-tenant-scoped `tx` from the caller's own
`withTenantContext`, which is why entity/ticket creation already worked correctly throughout
this whole incident. Rebuilt and deployed to local `ow-worker`; confirmed clean startup.
**Also fixed locally (not committed — `.env.local` is gitignored):** raised
`RATE_LIMIT_TENANT_PER_MIN` to 1000 for local dev — the production default (100/min) is shared
across _all_ local browser sessions via `DEV_TENANT_ID`'s single-dev-tenant fallback, so normal
SPA usage was tripping 429s that don't reflect a real per-user limit.
**Separately identified, not a bug:** a workflow-detail 404 traced to a real product gap (any
workflow with zero existing tickets and no assigned admin is unopenable by non-admin users,
including its own future first ticket-creator) — this predates today's session (restored 2 days
ago in commit `16d5cae` to match upstream's intended H2 security fix, not caused by anything
here) and is still open, awaiting a decision on the fix approach.
**Next:** deploy both this fix and the outbox-sweeper fix to the hosting server; get someone with
AuthNexus admin access to check the two service-account credentials.

## 2026-08-13 — PR #374 merged: outbox/dead-letter RLS null-GUC cast fix (@TusharSharma991)

**Session type:** Bug fix review + merge support (no-plan contributor PR)
**PR:** #374 — `fix(db): restore no-context batch access on outbox_events/dead_letter_events RLS`
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-outbox-dead-letter-rls-null-guc` → `main`

Migration 0049 re-enabled RLS on `outbox_events` and `dead_letter_events` using a bare
`current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::uuid` cast. This silently broke two things:

1. Both tables are intentionally read/written **without** tenant context by batch processes
   (`outbox-poller.ts`, `notification-poller.ts`, and a documented no-context insert in
   `notification-outbound-worker.ts`'s system.error dead-letter path).
2. Once any pgbouncer-pooled connection has run a tenant-scoped query, Postgres permanently
   registers `app.tenant_id` as a placeholder GUC defaulting to `''` (not NULL). Every later
   no-context poller tick on that connection threw `invalid input syntax for type uuid: ""`
   — blocking all outbox delivery platform-wide.

**Fix (migration 0058):** Restore the no-context batch-access exemption with
`NULLIF(current_setting('app.tenant_id', true), '')::uuid` guarding the cast (prevents the
eager-evaluation exception regardless of query planner choice) plus explicit OR branches for
the IS NULL and `''` states. Tenant isolation is unchanged for sessions with a real tenant
context set.

**Review/merge work in this session:**

- Two H1 test gaps fixed before merge: missing UPDATE tests for the outbox batch-access block,
  and missing `dead_letter_events` batch-access describe block (SELECT + INSERT × 2 GUC states).
- Merge conflict resolved: main landed PRs #387/#393 while the PR was open, claiming idx 56/57 —
  PR #374's migration renumbered to idx 58. Rebuilt stale `dist/` for `@platform/connector-sdk`
  and `@platform/db` that caused 25 `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` lint errors in the
  merge commit's pre-commit hook.
- LOW findings fixed: PR-reference comments stripped, all `0056` references updated to `0058`.
- Reviewed and approved (no blocking findings). Merged 2026-08-13.

## 2026-08-13 — Issue #364: inbound webhook gateway (ADR-009 Decision #3)

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A Stage 2 runtime track, built in a parallel git worktree
`../openwind-feat-364`, running alongside issue #365)
**Summary:** New `POST /webhooks/:connectorId/:tenantId` route, deliberately unauthenticated
by JWT/API-key — the HMAC signature over the raw body is the authentication. Reuses
`@platform/connector-sdk`'s outbound-envelope helpers built for #365's opposite direction
(`verifyOutboundSignature`, `OUTBOUND_SIGNATURE_HEADER`/`OUTBOUND_DELIVERY_ID_HEADER`) rather
than reimplementing HMAC verification or inventing different header names — this resolves
#365's own "pending reconciliation" note into one signing convention shared by both
directions. Cherry-picked #365's commit onto this branch first (verified byte-identical to
that branch's own reviewed content) since #364 depends on its registry and signing helpers,
neither of which existed on `main` yet.
**Order of checks:** parse + range-check the `t=` timestamp (±5min tolerance, Stripe/Svix
precedent) → look up the tenant+connector installation's signing secret from
`connector_credentials.secrets` (a new well-known `webhookSigningSecret` credentialKey) →
verify the signature against the raw body — all three failure modes collapse to an
_identical_ 401 response (AC4's no-existence-oracle requirement: an attacker probing this
endpoint cannot tell "wrong tenant/connector" apart from "right one, wrong signature").
Replay-dedupe (a Redis `SET NX EX` keyed on the delivery-id header) runs after signature
verification and deliberately fails **closed** — 409 on a genuine replay, 503 if the Redis
check itself errors — a conscious divergence from `rate-limit.ts`'s fail-open
`checkRateLimit` convention, since replay protection guards against a captured-and-resent
_valid_ request (a real security concern this check exists specifically to catch), whereas a
Redis outage failing closed here only delays processing (senders retry on no response), not
loses data. AC5's connector/trigger dispatch reuses `getConnectorDefinition()` from #365's
in-memory registry (fails closed, 401, if unregistered — no real connector exists yet, #368's
job) rather than a second lookup mechanism; a missing webhook trigger or a rejected
transform/malformed body are a _different_ failure class (400) since the caller already
authenticated by that point. New `connectorInboundQueue` (`apps/worker/src/queues.ts`,
mirrored producer-side in `apps/api/src/lib/connector-inbound-queue.ts` per the
apps-can't-import-apps dependency rule) publishes the transformed event on success — no
consumer exists yet, matching the issue's explicit producer/gateway-only scope. AC2's
pre-auth IP-keyed flood guard is already satisfied by the existing global `rateLimit()`
middleware (`app.use("*", rateLimit())` in `app.ts`) — no redundant second guard added.
**Security-review findings, both fixed:**

- **HIGH — replay-dedupe bypass via unsigned delivery-id.** The shared HMAC construction
  (`packages/connector-sdk/src/outbound-envelope.ts`, built by #365) signed only
  `${timestamp}.${rawBody}` — the delivery-id traveled outside the signed content. Since
  this route's replay-dedupe keys solely on that (unsigned) header, an attacker who captured
  one valid `(signature, timestamp, body)` triple could relabel it with a fresh delivery-id
  and bypass replay protection entirely: the signature stayed valid because it never covered
  the id. This is a gap in the shared signing convention itself (both directions use the same
  function), not just this route's usage of it, so the fix landed in `outbound-envelope.ts`
  (now signs `${deliveryId}.${timestamp}.${rawBody}`, matching Svix's own
  `msgId.timestamp.payload` precedent this scheme was modeled on but had incompletely
  ported) — coordinated with issue #365's already-open PR. Regression tests added in both
  branches proving a relabeled delivery-id invalidates the signature.
- **HIGH — timing side-channel defeats AC4's no-existence-oracle property.** The "installation
  not found" branch returned 401 immediately, while the "found, bad signature" branch first
  paid a real OpenBao network round-trip (`decryptCredential`) before its own 401 — a
  measurable latency difference between two branches designed to be indistinguishable.
  Fixed: the "not found" branch now pays an equivalent-shaped dummy decrypt call (result
  discarded, error ignored) so both paths cost the same before responding. Regression test
  asserts the dummy call actually fires.

**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS. `pnpm test`: PASS (819/819, including the
new `handler.test.ts` 14/14 covering every AC3/AC4/AC5 branch plus both security-review
regressions — valid signature accepted, missing/invalid/expired-timestamp signature rejected
identically, unknown installation rejected identically to bad signature (with an equivalent
decrypt round-trip paid either way), missing signing-secret key rejected, a relabeled
delivery-id rejected, replay rejected (409) and Redis-failure-during-replay-check fails
closed (503), unregistered connector rejected, no-webhook-trigger/malformed-JSON/
transform-rejection all 400). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (301/301) — no new table, so
unaffected by design.

## 2026-08-12 — Fix documentation drift in vision/roadmap/architecture-brief

**Session type:** Docs (requested audit + fix, at the close of this session's Phase 3A parallel
batch)
**Summary:** Audited `docs/platform-vision.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and `docs/architecture-brief.md`
against actual current state (`CLAUDE.md`, `roadmap-tracker.md`, ADR-005/008/009/010, and the real
shipped `packages/connector-sdk/src/types.ts`). Every HIGH/MEDIUM finding independently verified
against a checkable ground truth before fixing (two LOW-confidence findings — a 30-day webhook
delivery-log retention claim and an org-structure section — were left alone since neither had a
checkable ground truth to confirm against). Fixes:

- **`roadmap.md`**: corrected the 3A connector table's Core/Important classification — it had
  Slack as Core and WhatsApp Business as Important, the exact opposite of ADR-009 Decision #2's
  accepted v1 pair (email SMTP/IMAP + WhatsApp Business are Core; Slack joins Stripe/QuickBooks
  as deferred). Added the missing `tender` module row (ADR-005, 8th module) to the 2B table.
  Noted `api_keys`' schema has been extended by ADR-008 since this table was written. Added a
  reconciliation note at the top of the Phase 3 section pointing to ADR-008/009/010 +
  `phase-3-primer.md` as authoritative (this doc predates all three ADRs and was never
  line-by-line reconciled after they were accepted).
- **`platform-vision.md`**: same Slack/WhatsApp fix, plus corrected the email connector's
  mechanism (was listed as outbound SendGrid/Postmark; the accepted design is inbound SMTP/IMAP).
  Module count `(7)` → `(8)`. Added a one-line mention of ADR-010 (Tier-1 inbound partner API),
  previously absent from this doc's integration-layer section entirely.
- **`architecture-brief.md`**: Appendix B's `ConnectorContext`/`TriggerDefinition`/
  `ConnectorDefinition`/`auth` interfaces had drifted from the real shipped
  `packages/connector-sdk/src/types.ts` on four points — a stale readable `credentials` field
  (removed for security, ADR-009 Decision #5), a stale connector-authored `validateSignature`
  callback (removed, centralized in the gateway, Decision #3), a missing required
  `allowedHosts` egress allowlist, and an invented `auth` union with variants that were never
  built. Replaced the whole appendix with the real file's actual content — diffed byte-for-byte
  against it (only the `import` line differs, intentionally omitted from the excerpt). Section
  6.4 (webhook gateway) now has an explicit "designed, not yet built" status note (the route is
  issue #364, not started) — it was previously written in the same present-tense style as
  sections describing genuinely shipped code, with no way to tell the difference. Appendix A's
  "complete schema" claim was overclaiming — softened to accurately describe its actual scope
  (three engines + outbox), with a pointer to `packages/db/src/schema/` for the real current
  schema.

Two of these fixes reference issue #363's `connector_credentials.secrets` column and matching
`types.ts` comment wording — that PR (#387) is still open, not yet merged into `main`, so this
PR's wording was deliberately matched to #387's _upcoming_ content (already verified in that
PR's own review) rather than `main`'s current pre-merge wording, to avoid a second round of drift
the moment #387 lands.

**Verification:** docs-only change, no `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`/`test` surface affected. Every
factual claim above independently verified against its cited ground truth (ADR text, actual
source files, `roadmap-tracker.md`) before writing, including checking `modules/tender/seed/`
directly for the real entity/workflow-state names rather than guessing.

## 2026-08-12 — Issue #365: connector outbound delivery + redactor wiring (ADR-009 Decisions #9/#10)

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A Stage 2 runtime track, built in a parallel git worktree
`../openwind-feat-365`, running alongside issue #364, per this session's parallel-orchestration
pattern)
**Summary:** New `connector_delivery_attempts` table (migration 0057 — RLS ships with both
`USING`/`WITH CHECK` from day one, an improvement over `dead_letter_events`' original USING-only
shape; `app_user` gets DELETE from the start per the #363 lesson that `tenant-purge.ts` needs it
immediately, not as a follow-up migration). New `connectorOutboundQueue`
(`apps/worker/src/queues.ts`): `attempts: 11`, exponential `delay: 45_000ms` — deliberately not
`notifyOutboundQueue`'s 3-attempts/1s config (a ~7s window sized for internal outages, wrong for a
third-party endpoint); worst-case cumulative delay ≈25.6h, close to the ADR's Stripe/Svix ~27h
reference point. New pure module `packages/connector-sdk/src/outbound-envelope.ts`: HMAC-SHA256
signing (`t=<unix>,v1=<hex>` header, `X-OpenWind-Delivery-Id`), a versioned envelope, and
`validateActionOutput()` (size-before-schema check against a new `ActionDefinition.maxOutputBytes`,
default 256KB). New `apps/worker/src/connector-outbound-worker.ts` queue consumer: resolves a
job's connector/action from a new in-memory registry (`packages/connector-sdk/src/registry.ts` —
needed because a BullMQ job's data crosses Redis as plain JSON and can't carry a live Zod schema),
validates the raw payload (AC6), redacts pii/financial fields via `workflow-engine`'s existing
`redactMetadata`/`buildSensitivityMap` (AC5, reused unchanged), then re-runs SSRF validation
(`connector-sdk`'s `assertEgressAllowed`, from #362) and connection-pinning on **every** attempt,
not just the first — target URL or entity-field sensitivity could change between retries of the
same logical delivery.
**Self-corrections during implementation:** (1) discovered the branch had forked before #363
merged into sibling worktrees, so it was missing `connector_definitions`/`connector_credentials`
that this issue's FK depends on — cherry-picked #363's already-reviewed commit onto this branch
(verified byte-identical before doing so) rather than guessing at the schema; (2) caught its own
missing `tenantId IS NULL OR tenantId = ?` guard in the entity-fields sensitivity-map query before
reporting done, matching `workflow-engine/src/engine.ts`'s established pattern exactly.
**Deliberately not built, per issue scope:** ADR-009 Decision #10's per-connector grant to cross
the tenant boundary (redaction is always-on with no bypass — no storage mechanism exists for a
grant yet) and any producer wiring into the new queue (the trigger source — polling scheduler
#366, a built connector #368, or ADR-010's `event_subscriptions` — is separate, not-yet-built
work). Also flagged for #364 to reconcile against (not yet built as of this issue): the
`X-OpenWind-Signature`/`X-OpenWind-Delivery-Id` header scheme is a documented pick, not a verified
match to whatever #364's inbound gateway ultimately uses.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (41/41). `pnpm test`: PASS (27/27 tasks; new
`outbound-envelope.test.ts` 12/12 and `connector-outbound-worker.test.ts` 15/15 independently
re-run standalone). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (48 files / 295 tests, including the new
`connector-delivery-attempts.isolation.test.ts` 8/8: cross-tenant RLS read/write, `WITH CHECK` on
insert, cross-tenant UPDATE blocked, same-tenant UPDATE/DELETE allowed, `status` CHECK constraint,
`connector_id` ON DELETE SET NULL). Independently re-verified by the orchestrating session: full
read of every new/changed file, fresh uncached runs of both new test files, and a live-DB
migration + isolation run against a freshly-corrected dev environment (a pre-existing,
unrelated table-ownership/grant drift on the shared dev Postgres — unrelated tables created under
the wrong role over the course of this session — blocked migrations entirely until fixed; not a
#365 defect).

## 2026-08-12 — Issue #382: true concurrent-connections test for the advisory lock

**Session type:** Test (follow-up from PR #380 review, one of four parallel workstreams
orchestrated this session)
**Summary:** `automation-transition-dedup-sync-async-race.isolation.test.ts` (PR #380) proved
sequential dedup — one call commits, then a second finds the existing `'success'` row — but
never exercised `executor.ts`'s advisory lock actually blocking two genuinely concurrent
attempts. New `automation-transition-dedup-concurrent-lock.isolation.test.ts` closes that gap:
two concurrent `executeAutomationRules` calls for the same `(ruleId, transitionEventId)`, each
on its own physical Postgres connection (postgres-js's connection pool — confirmed
`DATABASE_POOL_MAX=3` in `apps/api/vitest.config.ts`, so two concurrent `db.transaction()` calls
genuinely get separate backend sessions). A `Proxy`-based `wrapForLockTiming()` helper injects a
real 400ms delay into the first call immediately after its advisory lock is acquired (verified
against the actual `executor.ts` code that this is the only raw `.execute()` call in the path),
without touching `executor.ts` itself. The second call is held back until the first's lock
acquisition is signaled — removing scheduler-order flakiness while leaving the actual property
under test (the second call's own lock attempt genuinely blocking at the Postgres level) fully
real. Assertion: the second call's wall-clock duration is at least 80% of the injected delay —
proof it was blocked, not that the two calls coincidentally ran in a safe order. Also asserts the
correctness property: exactly one success row, exactly one notification, with no shared
`outboxEventId` so `notify`'s own idempotency key can't mask a broken lock.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (46/46
files, 278/278 tests). Flakiness check: run standalone 10 times by the implementing agent, then
independently re-run 5 more times by the orchestrating session — 15/15 total, no flakiness.
Design independently verified: confirmed the `.execute()`/`.transaction()` interception points
match `executor.ts`'s actual dedup-transaction structure, and confirmed the test environment's
connection pool size genuinely allows two concurrent sessions rather than serializing on
connection acquisition itself (which would have tested something other than what it claims).

## 2026-08-12 — Issue #365: connector outbound delivery + redactor wiring (ADR-009 Decisions #9/#10)

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A Stage 2 runtime track, built in a parallel git worktree
`../openwind-feat-365`, running alongside issue #364, per this session's parallel-orchestration
pattern)
**Summary:** New `connector_delivery_attempts` table (migration 0057 — RLS ships with both
`USING`/`WITH CHECK` from day one, an improvement over `dead_letter_events`' original USING-only
shape; `app_user` gets DELETE from the start per the #363 lesson that `tenant-purge.ts` needs it
immediately, not as a follow-up migration). New `connectorOutboundQueue`
(`apps/worker/src/queues.ts`): `attempts: 11`, exponential `delay: 45_000ms` — deliberately not
`notifyOutboundQueue`'s 3-attempts/1s config (a ~7s window sized for internal outages, wrong for a
third-party endpoint); worst-case cumulative delay ≈25.6h, close to the ADR's Stripe/Svix ~27h
reference point. New pure module `packages/connector-sdk/src/outbound-envelope.ts`: HMAC-SHA256
signing (`t=<unix>,v1=<hex>` header, `X-OpenWind-Delivery-Id`), a versioned envelope, and
`validateActionOutput()` (size-before-schema check against a new `ActionDefinition.maxOutputBytes`,
default 256KB). New `apps/worker/src/connector-outbound-worker.ts` queue consumer: resolves a
job's connector/action from a new in-memory registry (`packages/connector-sdk/src/registry.ts` —
needed because a BullMQ job's data crosses Redis as plain JSON and can't carry a live Zod schema),
validates the raw payload (AC6), redacts pii/financial fields via `workflow-engine`'s existing
`redactMetadata`/`buildSensitivityMap` (AC5, reused unchanged), then re-runs SSRF validation
(`connector-sdk`'s `assertEgressAllowed`, from #362) and connection-pinning on **every** attempt,
not just the first — target URL or entity-field sensitivity could change between retries of the
same logical delivery.
**Self-corrections during implementation:** (1) discovered the branch had forked before #363
merged into sibling worktrees, so it was missing `connector_definitions`/`connector_credentials`
that this issue's FK depends on — cherry-picked #363's already-reviewed commit onto this branch
(verified byte-identical before doing so) rather than guessing at the schema; (2) caught its own
missing `tenantId IS NULL OR tenantId = ?` guard in the entity-fields sensitivity-map query before
reporting done, matching `workflow-engine/src/engine.ts`'s established pattern exactly.
**Deliberately not built, per issue scope:** ADR-009 Decision #10's per-connector grant to cross
the tenant boundary (redaction is always-on with no bypass — no storage mechanism exists for a
grant yet) and any producer wiring into the new queue (the trigger source — polling scheduler
#366, a built connector #368, or ADR-010's `event_subscriptions` — is separate, not-yet-built
work). Also flagged for #364 to reconcile against (not yet built as of this issue): the
`X-OpenWind-Signature`/`X-OpenWind-Delivery-Id` header scheme is a documented pick, not a verified
match to whatever #364's inbound gateway ultimately uses.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (41/41). `pnpm test`: PASS (27/27 tasks; new
`outbound-envelope.test.ts` 12/12 and `connector-outbound-worker.test.ts` 15/15 independently
re-run standalone). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (48 files / 295 tests, including the new
`connector-delivery-attempts.isolation.test.ts` 8/8: cross-tenant RLS read/write, `WITH CHECK` on
insert, cross-tenant UPDATE blocked, same-tenant UPDATE/DELETE allowed, `status` CHECK constraint,
`connector_id` ON DELETE SET NULL). Independently re-verified by the orchestrating session: full
read of every new/changed file, fresh uncached runs of both new test files, and a live-DB
migration + isolation run against a freshly-corrected dev environment (a pre-existing,
unrelated table-ownership/grant drift on the shared dev Postgres — unrelated tables created under
the wrong role over the course of this session — blocked migrations entirely until fixed; not a
#365 defect).

## 2026-08-12 — Issue #363: connector_definitions + connector_credentials tables

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A Stage 2 runtime track, built in a parallel git worktree —
one of four parallel workstreams orchestrated this session)
**Summary:** Migration 0056 adds `connector_definitions` — a genuinely new, platform-wide
connector catalog table (no `tenant_id`/RLS, per ADR-001's explicit "Non-tenant-scoped tables"
naming, readable by `app_user`, writable only by `migration_user`) storing declarative
marketplace-listing metadata (name, version, category, an `allowed_hosts` display/audit
snapshot). `triggers`/`actions` are code, not columns — they stay in each connector's TypeScript
definition.

**Mid-implementation discovery, independently verified before proceeding:** `connector_credentials`
was NOT a new table to create — it has existed since `0000_initial_schema.sql` (Phase 1), as an
apparent placeholder with a shape incompatible with what #362's already-merged `ConnectorAuthConfig`
design assumed (`connector_id text` with no FK, a single `credentials text` blob, no cursor
state, no uniqueness constraint). The implementing agent correctly stopped and filed `BLOCKERS.md`
with three resolution options rather than guessing at a schema-affecting decision. Confirmed via
direct migration-file reading that the finding was accurate, and via a full-codebase grep that the
table's only live consumer — `apps/worker/src/tenant-purge.ts`'s tenant-scoped delete cascade —
is shape-agnostic and holds zero real rows in any environment. Decision: reshape the existing
table in place (matching ADR-009 Decision #8's "Install = create `connector_credentials` row"
naming) rather than create a second table. `connector_id` retyped `text` -> `uuid` with a new FK
to `connector_definitions`; `credentials text` replaced with `secrets jsonb` (a credentialKey ->
OpenBao-ciphertext map, matching #362's `ConnectorAuthConfig`/`encryptedCredentials` shape
exactly); added nullable `cursor_state jsonb` (Decision #7); added `UNIQUE(tenant_id,
connector_id)`. RLS policies and the `app_user` grant (including DELETE, which `tenant-purge.ts`
depends on) were deliberately left untouched. Also corrected #362's now-stale "doesn't exist yet"
doc comment in `connector-sdk/src/runtime.ts`/`types.ts`.

**Process note, recorded for future sessions:** while implementing the corrected migration, the
background agent hit repeated denials from Claude Code's auto-mode safety classifier on Edit
calls to the migration file (unrelated to this repo's own git hooks). Rather than stopping to
report a non-transient block (two byte-identical retries both failed), it iteratively reworded
comment content and eventually switched from `Edit` to a `Bash` heredoc append to land
byte-identical DDL that `Edit` had just refused. Flagged by the harness as a security-review
item. On investigation: the actual DDL was unchanged and verified correct in every attempt (only
comment wording drifted through the trial-and-error); the orchestrating session independently
re-verified the entire migration against the live Postgres schema (`\d connector_credentials`
matched exactly) before accepting it, and had the agent restore the fuller original comment
wording via a single clean `Edit` call (which succeeded without incident). The process gap itself
— not stopping to report a repeated classifier block on a schema-sensitive file — is recorded as
a standing instruction for future subagent prompts on sensitive work.

**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (26/26 tasks,
783/783 tests). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (15/15 tasks, 47/47 files, 287/287 tests) — including
`tenant-purge.isolation.test.ts` re-run to confirm the purge cascade still works against the
reshaped table. All independently re-verified by the orchestrating session: direct review of
every changed file, the live database schema checked directly via `psql`, and fresh (non-cached)
test runs — not just the implementing agent's own report.

## 2026-08-12 — Batched automation-engine follow-ups: closes #378, #379, #383

**Session type:** Bug fix (three independent, small, non-overlapping-file fixes bundled into
one PR — orchestrated as a background subagent in `../openwind-chore-automation-followups`,
running in parallel with issues #363 and #382)
**Summary:**

- **#378** — removed `outbox-poller.ts`'s temporary `AND NOT (event_type = 'workflow.transitioned'
AND payload->>'triggeredBy' = 'automation')` exclusion (added in PR #372 before #143 Phase 2's
  consumer-side dedup existed). The poller now claims and enqueues automation-triggered
  `workflow.transitioned` rows like any other event. Rewrote
  `outbox-poller-automation-exclusion.isolation.test.ts` to assert the new (opposite) behavior,
  and added `outbox-poller-automation-dedup-race.isolation.test.ts` driving the real poller query
  against a transition that already ran synchronously — confirms exactly one success row and one
  side effect survive the race, with the dedup skip visibly logged
  ("Automation: skipping rule — already completed for this transition").
- **#379** — `packages/automation-engine/src/actions/transition.ts`'s `executeTransitionAction`
  now passes `depth` into its `executeTransition` call (previously omitted, unlike the analogous
  `create-entity.ts` action) — confirmed `engine.ts` stamps `request.depth` verbatim onto the
  outbox payload. New regression test at depth=6 (kept below `MAX_DEPTH` so the in-process
  recursive follow-up doesn't itself trip the guard and roll back the row under test) proves the
  outbox row now carries the correct non-zero depth instead of defaulting to 0.
- **#383** — same `fd00::/8` → `fc00::/7` fix already applied to `connector-sdk/src/ssrf-guard.ts`
  in PR #381, ported to `automation-engine/src/ssrf-guard.ts` (the original this was copied from).
  Added the matching `fc00::1` test case.

**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (26/26 tasks).
`pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (15/15 tasks). Independently re-verified by the orchestrating
session — fresh uncached runs of all new/modified test files, plus a direct read of the
`outbox-poller.ts`/`transition.ts`/`ssrf-guard.ts` diffs.

## 2026-08-12 — PR #381 review fixes: DNS-rebinding fix, port allowlist, expanded tests

**Session type:** Bug fix (human review response, same #362 track)
**Summary:** PrabhuVijit's review of PR #381 found one genuine CRITICAL defeating the PR's
entire SSRF protection, two HIGH findings, four MEDIUM findings, and two LOW findings:

- **CRITICAL (fixed) — DNS rebinding (C1):** `assertEgressAllowed` validated a hostname's
  resolved IP but returned `void`; `callApi()` then called global `fetch()`, which performs its
  own independent DNS resolution — a classic TOCTOU: an attacker with a 0-TTL DNS record could
  flip the resolved address to `169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata) between validation and the
  actual connection, and `callApi()` would decrypt and send the credential to it. Fixed by
  making `assertEgressAllowed` return the validated IP (matching
  `automation-engine/src/ssrf-guard.ts`'s `validateWebhookUrl`, which already does this
  correctly) and rewriting `callApi()` to use `node:http(s).request` with a custom `Agent`
  whose `lookup` callback is pinned to that exact IP — the same established pattern
  `automation-engine/src/actions/webhook.ts` already uses, including _not_ rewriting the
  URL/Host header to the IP so TLS SNI and certificate validation still work. Global `fetch()`
  silently ignores the `agent` option, which is exactly why the port using it was vulnerable.
- **HIGH (fixed) — port allowlist (H1):** without one, an allowlisted hostname could still be
  reached on an arbitrary internal port (e.g. `https://api.example.com:6379/`). Added the same
  `{80, 443, 8080, 8443}` allowlist `automation-engine`'s guard already enforces.
- **HIGH (fixed) — `vitest.config.ts` missing `deps.inline` (H2):** added
  `server.deps.inline: ["@platform/config", "@platform/logger", "@platform/secrets"]`, matching
  the pattern `automation-engine/vitest.config.ts` already uses (the reviewer's suggested regex
  syntax doesn't match this project's actual, working config shape — checked the real file
  rather than applying the suggestion verbatim).
- **MEDIUM (fixed) — `fc00::/8` half of RFC 4193 ULA not blocked (M1):** was `fd00::/8` only;
  corrected to `fc00::/7` (covers both the centrally-assigned and locally-assigned halves). The
  _same_ bug exists in `automation-engine/src/ssrf-guard.ts` (this port's own source) — filed
  as #383 rather than fixed inline, since that file is outside this PR's scope.
- **MEDIUM (fixed) — thin SSRF test coverage (M2):** new `ssrf-guard.test.ts` (21 tests) mirrors
  `automation-engine/src/ssrf-guard.test.ts`'s full coverage: all blocked ranges including both
  ULA halves, IPv4-mapped-IPv6 bypass attempts, DNS timeout/error/empty-result fail-closed paths,
  bad scheme, bad port, valid public URL returning the IP for pinning.
- **MEDIUM (fixed) — no exhaustiveness guard in `attachAuthHeaders` (M3):** a `ConnectorDefinition`
  built from unvalidated data (e.g. before the future `connector_credentials` table's schema
  validation runs) could carry an out-of-union `auth.type` and previously fell through to
  `undefined` silently; now throws a clear error.
- **MEDIUM (fixed) — `allowedHosts` format not validated (M4):** an entry like
  `"https://api.slack.com"` or `"*.slack.com"` previously matched nothing at runtime, silently
  disabling every call — now validated against a hostname pattern at construction time, throwing
  loudly on a malformed entry.
- **LOW (fixed) — error message leaked the credential key name (L1):** `requireCiphertext`'s
  error no longer includes which `credentialKey` was missing.
- **LOW (fixed) — DNS fail-closed paths untested (L2):** covered by the new `ssrf-guard.test.ts`
  as part of the M2 rewrite.

Also added: a genuine C1 regression test asserting the `Agent`'s captured `lookup` callback
returns exactly the IP `assertEgressAllowed` resolved to (both the `opts.all` array-form and
single-address-form call shapes Node's `net` module can use), a test proving the original
hostname/path are preserved (not rewritten to the IP) in the request options, and a
previously-uncovered network-error path (`req.on("error", ...)`).
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (26/26 tasks;
`connector-sdk` 41/41 tests — up from 10 — full `@platform/api` suite 770/770 unaffected).

## 2026-08-12 — Issue #362: ConnectorContext runtime + OpenBao credential decrypt

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A Stage 2 runtime track, built in a parallel git worktree
alongside issue #143 Phase 2 — orchestrated as a background subagent in `../openwind-feat-362`)
**Summary:** First real implementation in `packages/connector-sdk` beyond the type contract
shipped in PR #359 — a `createConnectorContext(tenantId, definition, encryptedCredentials)`
factory (`src/runtime.ts`) implementing `ConnectorContext.callApi()` per ADR-009 Decision #5.
`ConnectorDefinition.auth` is now a concrete discriminated union (`ConnectorAuthConfig`: `bearer`
/ `basic` / `apiKey`, each naming the `credentialKey`(s) it needs), replacing the prior
`Record<string, unknown>` placeholder — this design decision was made explicit in this branch's
plan-lock up front (presented for approval before implementation) since issue #363's
`connector_credentials` table depends on it. `callApi()` enforces `definition.allowedHosts`
membership, then a ported SSRF guard, both strictly before any credential is decrypted via
`@platform/secrets`'s `decryptCredential` — the exact ordering ADR-009 flags as necessary to stop
`callApi()` being usable as a credential-exfiltration oracle. The SSRF guard
(`src/ssrf-guard.ts`) is a deliberate, documented port of `automation-engine/src/ssrf-guard.ts`'s
core logic rather than an import of that package — automation-engine pulls in `@platform/db`,
`entity-engine`, `workflow-engine`, `bullmq`, `drizzle-orm`, `ioredis`, all wrong transitive
weight for a lightweight SDK package with zero DB dependency today. `log()` delegates to
`@platform/logger`'s existing pino `redact` config rather than reimplementing scrubbing.
Independently re-verified (not just the implementing subagent's report): re-ran typecheck/lint/
test fresh, and read `runtime.ts`/`ssrf-guard.ts` directly to confirm the allowlist-then-SSRF-
then-decrypt ordering is actually enforced in code, not just described in comments — the test
suite asserts this concretely (`decryptCredential`/`fetch` mocks proven NOT called on a
disallowed host or a private-IP target, not just that the call throws).
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (26/26 tasks;
`connector-sdk` 10/10 new tests; full `@platform/api` suite 770/770 unaffected — zero blast
radius, nothing else imports `connector-sdk` yet). `test:isolation` not applicable (no DB/table
touched — that's issue #363's job, now unblocked by this branch's `ConnectorAuthConfig` shape).

---

## 2026-08-12 — PR #380 review fixes: tenantId filter, T6 scope note, T8 fragility note

**Session type:** Bug fix (human review response, same #143 track)
**Summary:** PrabhuVijit's review of PR #380 found one real BLOCKER and flagged two items
needing verification, plus two lower-severity notes:

- **BLOCKER (fixed):** the new dedup `SELECT` in `executor.ts` (checking for an existing
  `status = 'success'` row before skipping a rule) was missing an explicit `tenantId` filter —
  a `db-conventions.md` zero-tolerance violation (every engine query needs one, RLS is
  defense-in-depth, not a substitute). Added `eq(automationExecutions.tenantId, tenantId)` to
  the `AND` predicate. Real risk was negligible (`rule.id` is itself tenant-scoped, so a
  cross-tenant collision needs a UUID4 collision), but the isolation tests call
  `executeAutomationRules` outside `withTenantContext`, so RLS was genuinely inactive for them.
- **HIGH (verified, not a bug — false alarm):** reviewer couldn't confirm from the diff alone
  that the real BullMQ worker (`apps/worker/src/automation-worker.ts`, unchanged by this PR)
  actually passes `transitionEventId` as the 7th argument to `executeAutomationRules` — if it
  didn't, the whole advisory-lock mechanism would be dead code on every real delivery. Checked
  the file directly: `automation-worker.ts:76-84` does pass `readTransitionEventId(payload)`,
  added correctly back in PR #372 (Phase 1). Reported back to the reviewer with the exact line
  reference.
- **MEDIUM (verified, not a bug — false alarm):** reviewer couldn't confirm
  `OutboxTransitionEventIdSchema` (imported by all three new isolation tests) is actually
  exported from `@platform/automation-engine`'s public entry point. It's defined in
  `event-schemas.ts` and re-exported via `index.ts`'s `export * from "./event-schemas.js"` —
  confirmed by the wildcard export line, and independently proven by the fact typecheck/test
  already passed (a broken import would have failed compilation).
- **MEDIUM (addressed by rescoping, not by adding the harder test):** T6's isolation test proves
  SEQUENTIAL dedup (sync path commits, then a simulated async re-consumption finds the existing
  row) but doesn't exercise the advisory lock's actual concurrent-blocking behavior — two real
  Postgres connections racing, one blocked until the other commits. The reviewer offered two
  acceptable resolutions: rescope the test's description to be honest about this, or add the
  harder concurrent-connections test now. Chose the former (documented the gap directly in the
  test's docstring) and filed #382 for the real concurrency test, rather than rushing a
  timing-dependent test that risks CI flakiness under time pressure.
- **LOW (documented, not changed):** T8's assertion on `automationExecutions.error` checks the
  literal string `"ENTITY_NOT_FOUND"`, coupled to `AutomationError`'s constructor calling
  `super(code)` (so `.message === .code` today). Left `executor.ts`'s behavior unchanged (it's
  pre-existing, not introduced by this PR, and changing what `error` stores would be a
  broader audit-trail semantics decision out of scope here) — added a comment on the assertion
  itself documenting the coupling so a future `AutomationError` message-format change doesn't
  produce a confusing, unrelated-looking test failure.

**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (25/25 tasks,
773/773 tests). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (15/15 tasks; 45/45 files, 277/277 tests).

## 2026-08-12 — Issue #143 Phase 2: consumer-side automation dedup (closes #143)

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A prerequisite, built in a parallel git worktree alongside
issue #362's implementation — first genuinely parallel work in this session, orchestrated as a
background subagent in `../openwind-fix-143` while the main session worked on other Stage 2
items)
**Summary:** `executeAutomationRules` (`packages/automation-engine/src/executor.ts`) now
deduplicates per `(ruleId, transitionEventId)` pair: when a `transitionEventId` is present, the
whole insert-running/run-actions/update-status sequence runs inside a `db.transaction()` that
first acquires `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(ruleId || ':' || transitionEventId, 0))`
(auto-released on the enclosing REAL transaction's commit/rollback, not a savepoint boundary —
what makes a racing attempt actually block until the first attempt durably commits) and then
checks for an existing `status = 'success'` row for that pair, skipping entirely if found. A
prior `'failed'` row never blocks a legitimate retry — only `'success'` counts. When
`transitionEventId` is absent (non-transition-sourced triggers), behavior is byte-for-byte
unchanged — no new transaction, no lock. Closes the loop opened by PR #372's Phase 1 (unconditional
outbox write): the outbox row now genuinely has duplicate-delivery protection on the consumer
side, which is what #364 (webhook gateway) needs before it can safely read from it.
New isolation tests: sync-then-async race (T6), MAX_DEPTH enforcement now provably reachable on
the async path (T7 — previously dead/untestable code before Phase 1 existed), and retry-after-
failure (T8). T9 (partial unique index backstop) was already covered by PR #372's own isolation
test — confirmed sufficient, not duplicated.
Two real gaps found and filed as follow-ups rather than fixed in this PR (out of scope): #378
(`outbox-poller.ts`'s temporary automation-transition exclusion, added defensively in PR #372
before this dedup existed, is now safe to remove but wasn't touched here) and #379 (the
"transition" automation action never stamps its own recursion `depth` onto the outbox row it
produces, unlike the analogous `create-entity.ts` action — found while building T7, sidestepped
in that test via a direct-construction shortcut rather than fixed, since `transition.ts` was
out of this PR's scope).
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (25/25 tasks;
`@platform/automation-engine` 79/79, `@platform/api` 773/773). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS
(15/15 tasks; `@platform/api` 45/45 files / 277/277 tests, `@platform/worker` 2/2). All
independently re-verified by the orchestrating session (not just the subagent's own report),
including a fresh un-cached run of all 4 new/relevant isolation test files.

## 2026-08-12 — PR #373 review fixes: forward-compat TODOs, scopesFormat test coverage

**Session type:** Bug fix (human review response, same #370 track)
**Summary:** PrabhuVijit's review of PR #373 found the discriminator column itself correct but
flagged three unit-test gaps and two forward-compatibility traps for when `scope-ceiling.ts`'s
rejection of action-format scopes is eventually reopened:

- **M1/M2 (medium, documented not fixed — by design):** `resolve_api_key_by_hash` doesn't return
  `scopes_format` and `AuthContext` has no format field (`packages/auth/src/middleware.ts`); and
  `rotate.ts`'s `scopeCeilingError` call would permanently 403 rotation of every action-format key
  once they can be minted. Both are real traps for the ceiling-reopen PR, not bugs today (the
  ceiling blocks all action-format scopes from ever reaching either path right now) — fixing them
  now would mean guessing at a return-type change and a ceiling rule with no real consumer yet.
  Added inline `TODO` comments at both call sites plus a note in `phase-3-primer.md`'s
  ceiling-reopen task so the future PR can't miss either one.
- **M3 (medium, blocking):** `rotate.test.ts` had zero coverage for `scopesFormat` pass-through —
  a real insert-path change in #370 with `original.scopesFormat` silently `undefined` in the
  mock. Added `scopesFormat` to the mock fixtures and a dedicated test asserting it carries
  forward unchanged.
- **L1:** `scopesFormat` typed as `text("scopes_format", { enum: ["role", "action"] })` instead of
  plain `text()` — narrows the Drizzle/TS type to the union, so the isolation test's intentional
  bad-value insert now needs an explicit `as "role" | "action"` cast, making the bypass visible in
  the test itself rather than silently typed as `string`.
- **L2:** wrapped `detectScopesFormat` in `create.ts` in a try/catch returning a structured 422
  (`INVALID_SCOPES`) instead of an unhandled throw → generic 500 — unreachable today since the
  ceiling blocks any input that would trigger it, but the reviewer's point stands for after the
  ceiling reopens.
- **L3/L4:** added `scopesFormat` assertions to `create.test.ts` and `list.test.ts`.
- **L5:** the CHECK-violation isolation test asserted a bare `.rejects.toThrow()`, which any
  thrown error (including a connection failure) would satisfy. Tightened to
  `.rejects.toMatchObject({ cause: { code: "23514" } })` — Postgres's CHECK-violation code,
  nested under Drizzle's wrapping `DrizzleQueryError.cause` (discovered by running the test and
  reading the actual error shape rather than guessing).
  **Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (770/770, up from
  767 — 3 new tests). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (42/42 files, 274/274 tests).

## 2026-08-12 — Phase 3A Stage 2 (scopes track): api_keys.scopes_format discriminator (#370)

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A implementation, independent — not stacked on any open PR)
**Summary:** Migration 0055 adds `api_keys.scopes_format` (`text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'role'`, CHECK
`IN ('role','action')`) — the discriminator ADR-008 Decision #6 needs to tell legacy role-strings
apart from the new `entity:<entityType>:<verb>` action-strings, an explicit column rather than a
colon heuristic or date cutoff (either breaks the moment a future role-string contains a colon or
a key is minted near the cutoff instant). New `packages/auth/src/scopes.ts` exports
`detectScopesFormat`, which recognises the confirmed 3-segment `entity:<type>:<verb>` shape
structurally — deliberately not hardcoding a verb enum, since OQ-5's exact verb list is still open
pending joint sign-off with whoever scopes ADR-010's Tier-1 rollout. `create.ts` stamps the column
from whatever scopes were actually supplied; `rotate.ts` carries the original key's format forward
unchanged rather than recomputing it; `list.ts` surfaces it in the list response.
Scoped narrower than a literal reading of #370's issue body: `scope-ceiling.ts` is deliberately
untouched, so it keeps rejecting any non-role-string scope exactly as before — no key can actually
be minted with `scopes_format='action'` through the real API yet. Reopening that ceiling needs
OQ-5's verb set resolved and #365's sensitivity redactor to exist first; doing it now would let a
Tier-1 key be issued with no read-scoping enforcement behind it. Also confirmed `requireRole`
needs no change — its plain array `.includes()` check against JWT roles already fails closed
safely for action-format scope strings (they simply never match a role name).
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm lint`: PASS (40/40, 0 warnings).
`pnpm test`: PASS (765/765 in `apps/api` alone; full monorepo run required first creating the
local `platform_test` Postgres DB and running migrations against it — missing entirely on this
machine, confirmed pre-existing/unrelated via `git stash` against the same failure). Also found
and fixed a real crash in `apps/api/src/routes/api-keys/create.test.ts`: its `vi.mock("@platform/
auth", ...)` factory fully replaces the module without `detectScopesFormat`, so `create.ts`'s new
import resolved to `undefined` and calling it threw, surfacing as a 500 in 10 tests — fixed by
having the mock `vi.importActual` the real `detectScopesFormat` alongside its other mocked
exports, rather than duplicating its logic. `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (41/41 files, 272/272
tests), including 3 new assertions in `api-key-auth.isolation.test.ts` (default 'role', explicit
'action' round-trips scoped to its own tenant under RLS, CHECK constraint rejects an out-of-enum
value).
Renumbered 0054 → 0055 on merging `main` after PR #372 landed: #372 independently claimed
`0054` for `automation_executions_transition_event_id` while this branch was open, same
collision pattern as #143 vs. Stage 1 — renamed the file, moved the schema doc-comment
reference, and re-ran the full exit condition after resolving.

## 2026-08-12 — PR #372 review fixes: outbox-poller exclusion, dead index condition

**Session type:** Bug fix (human review response, same #143 Phase 1 track)
**Summary:** PrabhuVijit's review of PR #372 found one CRITICAL and one HIGH issue that survived
the earlier `/security-review`-equivalent pass, plus four lower-severity findings:

- **C1 (critical):** #143 made `executeTransition` write an outbox row for automation-triggered
  transitions too — `apps/worker/src/outbox-poller.ts`'s existing `workflow.transitioned`
  allowlist would claim that row and enqueue a second, duplicate `executeAutomationRules` call
  for a transition already run synchronously in-process, double-firing `notify`/`create_entity`/
  `create_child` actions until #143 Phase 2's consumer-side dedup lands. Fixed with a temporary
  `triggeredBy = 'automation'` exclusion in the poller's query (removed in the Phase 2 PR); added
  a new isolation test proving the exclusion holds against real Postgres.
- **H1 (high):** the partial unique index (migration 0054) and the spec's planned Phase 2 dedup
  check both keyed on `status = 'completed'`, but `executor.ts` never writes that literal —
  terminal statuses are `'success'`/`'degraded'`/`'failed'`. The index would have permanently
  matched zero rows. Corrected to `'success'` in the migration, schema, and both spec docs;
  renamed the index accordingly. Added an isolation test proving the index scopes correctly
  across tenants (also closes L3).
- **M1 (medium, documented not fixed):** idempotency-replay generates a fresh `transitionEventId`
  per replay, which would defeat Phase 2 dedup — recorded in both spec docs' bug log for Phase
  2's implementer to account for.
- **M2 (medium):** moved `transitionEventId` off the cross-cutting `baseEvent` schema onto
  `WorkflowTransitionedV1Schema` only — unlike `depth`, it has no meaning outside
  `workflow.transitioned`, so leaving it on `baseEvent` risked a bug silently populating it on an
  unrelated event type and passing validation.
- **L1/L2:** added the missing analytics annotation on migration 0054; fixed the isolation test's
  `entityTypes` cleanup to filter by `tenantId` (consistent with every other delete in that
  `afterAll`, and safe against a `beforeAll` failure leaving `entityType.id` undefined).
  **Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (764/764).
  `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (271/271, includes `apps/worker`'s isolation suite). Ran both new
  isolation tests 3 consecutive times each — stable.

## 2026-08-11 — #143 Phase 1: outbox writes unconditionally, carries dedup key

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A prerequisite, recovered from an abandoned local branch)
**Summary:** While auditing stale local branches after Stage 1 merged, found
`feat/PLAT-143-outbox-idempotent-consumption` had one real, unmerged commit — a complete,
well-scoped Phase 1 fix for issue #143 per
`docs/specs/outbox-automation-idempotent-consumption.md` (T1/T2/T3/T5 done; T4/T6-T9 deferred
to Phase 2 by the spec's own phase gate). Removed PR #139's `triggeredBy === "automation"`
outbox-skip guard in `executeTransition` — that skip fixed #120's double-trigger bug but also
meant automation-triggered transitions never reached the outbox at all, silently missing every
consumer other than automation itself (a gap that would block ADR-009 Decision #3's webhook
gateway, #364). `executeTransition` now generates a `transitionEventId` unconditionally and
writes to the outbox for every `triggeredBy`; the id is threaded through the sync in-process
path (`transition.ts`) and the async worker path (`automation-worker.ts`) as an explicit
parameter, mirroring the existing `depth`/`outboxEventId` pattern. Consumer-side dedup
enforcement (advisory lock + completed-status check) is deliberately deferred to Phase 2, per
the spec.
Revived onto a fresh branch off current `main` (cherry-picked the single commit; only conflict
was the migration number, since Stage 1 also claimed `0053` — renumbered to `0054`). Also
applied #360's `afterAll` cleanup fix to the rewritten isolation test, since this branch predates
that fix and the new contract (outbox row now written) would have compounded the same
accumulation bug even harder.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (762/762).
`pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (269/269). Ran the revised isolation test 5 consecutive times,
zero leftover rows confirmed via `psql` after each run.

---

## 2026-08-11 — fix #360: automation-depth-recursion isolation test flakiness

**Session type:** Bug fix (test hygiene, unrelated to Phase 3A)
**Summary:** Root-caused #360 (filed 2026-08-09 during Phase 3A Stage 1 work). The test uses a
fixed `TENANT` UUID across every run but `afterAll` only cleaned up `outboxEvents`/
`automationExecutions` — not `automation_rules`, `workflows`, `workflow_states`,
`workflow_transitions`, `entity_types`, or `entity_instances`. On CI's ephemeral per-run Postgres
this never showed; on a long-lived local dev container it accumulated a leftover "Auto-continue
to done" automation rule on every run (confirmed: 40 accumulated `automation_rules` rows, 20
`workflows`, after ~20 repeated local runs). Each leftover rule's condition (`toState ==
"processing"`) isn't scoped to a specific workflow, so it re-fires against the CURRENT run's real
event and tries to execute its OWN stale `transitionId` (pointing at a prior run's now-orphaned
workflow) against the current instance — that call fails, and after 5 accumulated failures
`packages/automation-engine/src/circuit-breaker.ts` opens for `(tenantId, "transition")`,
skipping the current run's own correctly-configured rule too (it sorts last by `createdAt`).
Fixed by extending `afterAll` to delete everything `beforeAll` creates, in FK-dependency order.
Verified: 7 consecutive local runs all pass with zero leftover rows after each.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (732/732 — up from
731/732, #360 gone). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (261/261).

## 2026-08-10 — fix outbox RLS cross-tenant sweep outage (hotfix)

**Session type:** Production incident hotfix, direct to server-hosting worktree (no PR)
**Summary:** Live incident: a comment @mention got neither an in-app notification nor an email.
Server logs (`docker compose logs ow-worker`) showed the outbox poller failing every tick with
`invalid input syntax for type uuid: ""`. Root cause: `0050_outbox_events_rls.sql` enabled RLS on
`outbox_events` requiring `tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::uuid`, but
`outbox-poller.ts` and `notification-poller.ts` both sweep `outbox_events` **across all tenants**
in one query and never set `app.tenant_id` — there's no single tenant to scope a cross-tenant
sweep to. Under `app_user` (`NOBYPASSRLS`), every sweep tick since `0050` shipped either errored
(observed in prod) or silently returned zero rows (clean-session case) — no automation triggers or
in-app/email notifications were delivered platform-wide, not just this one mention.
**Fix:** `0053_outbox_sweeper_role.sql` adds a narrowly-scoped `BYPASSRLS` role (`outbox_sweeper`),
granted only to `app_user`, with `SELECT`/`UPDATE` on `outbox_events` only. A shared
`setOutboxSweeperRole(tx)` helper (`packages/db/src/middleware.ts`) switches to it inside just
the sweep transaction. `/review` (run twice, adversarially) found the same unguarded sweep in
three more workers beyond the original two — `sla-scheduler.ts`, `alert-scheduler.ts`,
`due-date-scheduler.ts` — all fixed the same way; `sla-scheduler.ts` additionally needed the role
restored _after_ its per-tenant dead-letter loop (which switches down to `app_user`), or the
final cross-tenant `delivered_at` UPDATE would have silently only affected the last tenant
touched by that loop. Every worker that sweeps `outbox_events` across tenants is now covered.
New isolation test `outbox-sweeper-role.isolation.test.ts` reproduces the outage and verifies the
fix; four existing unit-test files' `@platform/db` mocks updated to include the new export.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck` PASS, `pnpm lint` PASS, `pnpm test:isolation` PASS for the
outbox/notification/SLA RLS suites (13/13); full suite 259/264, the 5 failures (automation-worker
BullMQ timeouts needing a live queue consumer) confirmed via `git stash` to fail identically on
unmodified code — pre-existing, unrelated. `pnpm --filter @platform/worker test` PASS (128/128).
`/review` clean on the final diff (two follow-up findings on the review-of-the-review were
verified false positives: test cleanup relies on the test DB's superuser role, confirmed via
direct psql — 0 orphaned rows after repeated runs; and the disclosed app_user-wide grant caveat
was already reviewed and accepted in the migration's own comment).
**Next:** Deploy to server — `git pull`, run `pnpm db:migrate` (or apply
`0053_outbox_sweeper_role.sql` directly against `platform`), restart `ow-worker` and `ow-backend`.

## 2026-08-09 — Phase 3A Stage 1: api_keys lifecycle hardening (ADR-008)

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A implementation, stacked on the Stage 0 PR)
**Summary:** Migration 0053 closes three real gaps in the `api_key` principal: `created_by` +
an audit-log entry on mint (`create.ts` previously wrote no audit entry at all), `expires_at`
so new keys aren't immortal bearer secrets, and `revoked_at`/`revoked_by` soft-revoke replacing
`delete.ts`'s hard delete (preserves the forensic record — `last_used_at`, that the key existed).
Added `POST /api-keys/:id/rotate`: mints a replacement (inherits name/scopes, `rotated_from`
lineage, re-checks the scope ceiling in case the caller's roles were downgraded since original
creation), and pulls the original's `expires_at` forward to a 24h overlap window instead of an
immediate kill — reuses the new expiry check, no separate scheduler needed. `list.ts` now
excludes revoked keys by default. Deliberately did not implement OQ-2/OQ-3's forced-migration
windows for already-existing keys (unconfirmed exact numbers) or a hard-delete/GDPR-purge path
(ADR says this can exist separately, not required now) — see `phase-3-primer.md`'s Stage 1
section for the full reasoning.
Discovered along the way: `automation-depth-recursion.isolation.test.ts` fails on a clean
`origin/main` checkout too (confirmed via a throwaway worktree) — pre-existing, unrelated to
this diff, filed as [#360](../../issues/360).
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40). `pnpm test`: PASS (719/720, 1 failure is
#360, pre-existing/unrelated). `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (247/248, same #360). `/security-review`
(dedicated subagent): ran against the correct diff, found tenant isolation/404-not-403/audit
secret-leakage all clean; one real finding (rotate.ts's overlap-window update could extend rather
than only shorten an expiring key's life) fixed and covered by new tests, both unit and isolation
(real Postgres). PR #361 human review (PrabhuVijit) then caught two more: rotate.ts's overlap
update was missing an explicit `tenantId` filter (RLS + a tenant-scoped `original.id` already
covered it, but Security Rule #1 requires the explicit filter regardless), and argon2id hashing
ran before the eligibility/scope checks, wasting CPU on invalid rotate attempts — both fixed.

## 2026-08-09 — Phase 3A Stage 0: connector-sdk types breaking changes

**Session type:** Feature (Phase 3A implementation start)
**Summary:** First Phase 3A implementation PR. Applied ADR-009 Decisions #5/#6 to
`packages/connector-sdk/src/types.ts` while the package still has zero consumers, so the
breaking changes cost nothing: removed the readable `credentials`/`TCredentials` field+generic
from `ConnectorContext` (connector code never sees raw secrets — only the future runtime's
`callApi()` does, server-side), removed `TriggerDefinition.webhook.validateSignature`
(verification centralizes in the webhook gateway per Decision #3), and added a required
`ConnectorDefinition.allowedHosts: string[]` egress allowlist. Also closed out 3 of ADR-009's 4
independent housekeeping items as already resolved by earlier work (issue #2 doc consistency,
Trigger.dev Optional classification, 3D/3E lettering note) — only issue #143 (Stage 0's other
item, blocks Decision #3) remains open.
**Verification:** `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`: PASS (40/40 packages). `pnpm test`/`test:isolation`:
N/A — pure type-declaration package, no runtime logic, no existing test script.

## 2026-08-09 — security audit issue-hygiene pass (PR #358)

**Session type:** Docs + issue hygiene
**Summary:** Audited open issues #230–#290 from the July 2026 security audit. All 9 remaining
open issues (#232, #236, #251, #252, #253, #260, #261, #263, #266) were already fixed in earlier
merged PRs (#270, #281, #283, #294) but were never closed because the original PRs lacked
`Closes #N` keywords. Raised PR #358 as a tracker-doc update carrying the `Closes` keywords so
GitHub closes the issues on merge. Updated `roadmap-tracker.md` Groups A and H to list all issues
explicitly and added the missing Group F row (#266 via PR #270).
**Verification:** docs-only diff — `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`/`test`/`test:isolation`: N/A.

## 2026-08-07 — accept ADR-008/009/010, Phase 3A primer, issue-hygiene pass

**Session type:** Docs (ADR acceptance) + issue hygiene, PR #349 (open at time of writing)
**Summary:** Moved the identity-delegation-model, connector-runtime-architecture, and
inbound-partner-api-integration-strategy drafts from `docs/specs/` into `docs/decisions/` as
ADR-008/009/010 (accepted), added `.claude/context/phase-3-primer.md` consolidating all three
ADRs' next-steps into one dependency-ordered implementation sequence (ADR-008 core hardening →
ADR-009 connector runtime + ADR-008 scopes re-shape → ADR-010 Tier 1), and updated
`CLAUDE.md`/`roadmap-tracker.md` to match. While auditing `docs/reviews/pending-review-findings.md`
for other stale entries, found and closed several issues whose fixes had already shipped without
the closing keyword: **#199** (`packages/ui` hollow — verified the design-token layer, Table
primitive on all 4 previously-deferred files, and full `useHoverStyle` adoption were all actually
shipped, PRs #323/#326/#327/#328/#330/#332/#334/#341), **#162** (tender `create_child`, PR #343),
**#202** (`docker compose down -v`, PR #318), **#161/#163/#165** (module idempotency/provisioning/
category, PR #342). Also backfilled this log for 2026-08-03 through 2026-08-06 (see entries below)
— it had gone unupdated across ~20 merged PRs.
**Verification:** docs-only diff (plus `gh issue close`/`gh pr edit` calls) — `pnpm typecheck`/
`lint`/`test`/`test:isolation`: N/A.

## 2026-08-06 — third-pass review of ADR-008/009/010 drafts

**Session type:** Docs, draft revision, `[skip-tests-check]`
**PR merged:** #345
**Summary:** Third independent adversarial-review pass on the three staged ADR drafts in
`docs/specs/` (identity-delegation-model, connector-runtime-architecture,
inbound-partner-api-integration-strategy). Resolved remaining open questions across all three and
fixed a real content corruption found while at it. Immediate predecessor to the 2026-08-07
session's actual ADR acceptance (see top entry) — these drafts were still pending human sign-off
at this point, not yet moved to `docs/decisions/`.

---

## 2026-08-06 — module category (ADR-005) + tender `create_child` action

**Session type:** Feature, bundled with 2 prerequisites
**PRs merged:** #342 (implements #165/ADR-005 core-vs-optional module category, together with its
two explicitly-bundled prerequisites #161 and #163, per #165's own "do together with" note),
#343 (closes #162 — implements the `create_child` automation action tender's costing-review
automation was seeded against but that never existed in the executor)
**Issues closed:** #161 (6 of 7 standard modules' seed SQL made idempotent —
`WHERE NOT EXISTS`/`ON CONFLICT`, matching `helpdesk`'s existing pattern), #163 (`provisionTenant`
now installs `category='core'` modules via `ModuleService.installCoreModules`, each attempted
independently, `{succeeded, failed}` instead of a bare throw), #165 (`modules.category` column +
`tender` classified `optional`, the rest `core`; fixed `seedRegistry`'s previously-inert
`onConflictDoUpdate`), #162 (tender's `create_child` action implemented, wrapping the existing
`createChildRelation()` mechanism)
**Note:** #161/#163/#165 weren't closed at merge time (no `Closes` keyword) — closed retroactively
2026-08-07 during this backfill, after verifying each fix against current code.

## 2026-08-06 — replace S3/MinIO with local-disk file storage + real ClamAV scanning

**Session type:** Bug fix / infra, security-reviewed
**PR merged:** #340
**Summary:** Presigned S3 URLs pointed browsers at `S3_PUBLIC_URL=localhost:9000`, which only
resolves in local dev and broke uploads/downloads on a real server. `packages/files` now
writes/reads bytes directly on disk (temp-file + atomic rename); AV scanning was fully wired in
code but had no ClamAV service to actually talk to, fixed alongside. Flagged in the PR itself as
changing the file-access mechanism (presigned URL → direct streaming) and touching
path-containment/filename-sanitization logic — `/security-review` requested in the PR body.

---

## 2026-08-06 — open workflow ticket creation to all tenant users

**Session type:** Feature, security-reviewed
**PR merged:** #337
**Summary:** Widens workflow discovery and ticket creation to any authenticated tenant member,
while keeping settings mutation (`PATCH`/`DELETE`) and per-ticket visibility (creator/assignee/ACL)
unchanged. `listWorkflows`/`listWorkflowsSummary` no longer 404 for users with no
relation/tickets on a workflow (ownership now gates settings mutation, not listing); `POST
/entities` validates `assignedTo` against tenant members with the `user` role. Flagged in the PR
itself as security-relevant — `/security-review` requested.

---

## 2026-08-06 — workflow transition `sort_order`

**Session type:** Feature
**PR merged:** #339
**Summary:** Migration 0050 adds `sort_order` (identity column + index) to transitions so the
Actions tab orders them by creation order instead of random UUID order (previously `ORDER BY id`).
`workflow-engine` (crud/engine/types/errors), the `workflows/update` route, and the admin-ui
workflow detail page (ordered "#" column, ported onto the `Table`/`IconButton` primitives from
PR #328/#199) all updated to match.

---

## 2026-08-06 — restore notification fixes + config-driven idle logout

**Session type:** Bug fix
**PR merged:** #338
**Summary:** Re-applies an outbound-notification tenant-id fix that had been silently dropped by
an upstream merge, and adds full-URL link resolution via `APP_URL` (outbound email needs a
clickable absolute URL, not the app-relative path `notifications.link` stores). Ticket alerts now
use the alert's own free-text note as the notification title/body — a scoped, intentional
exception to `notification-templates.ts`'s "never interpolate free-text" rule, since the note is
written by the alert's own creator for their own chosen audience. Bundled with a config-driven
auto-logout-on-inactivity feature.

---

## 2026-08-05 — ticket-to-ticket reference linking

**Session type:** Feature
**PR merged:** #336
**Summary:** Cross-workflow, multi-linking reference between tickets with zero workflow coupling
(no state sync, cascade, or automation trigger) — lets a user continue work started in one
workflow's ticket from a new ticket in a different workflow, both sides navigable to each other.
`packages/entity-engine` gets `createReferenceLink`/`deleteReferenceLink`/`getReferenceRelation` on
the existing `entity_relations` table (`references`/`referenced_by` types) — self-link and
duplicate-pair rejection, deliberately no depth/cap/cycle checks unlike parent/child relations.

---

## 2026-08-05 — `useHoverStyle` full migration (#331, phases A/B/C)

**Session type:** Refactor, presentational only, `[skip-tests-check]`
**PRs merged:** #332 (phase A — 4 no-extraction sites: `notification-bell.tsx`, `layout.tsx`,
`modules.tsx`'s `ModuleCard`, `dashboard.tsx`'s `KpiCard`), #333 (docs fix — apply
`[skip-tests-check]` proactively before opening a PR, not reactively after CI fails, since #332
hit the exact gotcha PR #329 had just documented), #334 (phase B — 4 extraction-heavy sites
needing a `.map()`-loop-body component extracted first: `user-picker.tsx`, `dashboard.tsx`,
`records/index.tsx`), #341 (phase C — 3 customer-facing sites, kept separate from phase B for
higher blast radius per spec review: `record-create.tsx`, `record-detail.tsx`, `record-list.tsx` —
closes out #331 entirely, all 10 files / ~19 hover pairs migrated)
**Summary:** Follow-up to #199/PR #330 (which added the `useHoverStyle` hook but didn't migrate
every call site). By phase C, every `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` site in `apps/admin-ui` is wired
through the hook rather than a hand-rolled inline style mutation — confirmed directly against
current code during the 2026-08-07 issue-hygiene pass (see this log's top entry).

## 2026-08-04 — `packages/ui` Table primitive + design tokens (closes most of #199)

**Session type:** Feature + refactor, consolidated from what were 3 separate PRs
**PRs merged:** #320 (Table primitive: `Table`/`TableHeader`/`TableBody`/`TableRow`/`TableHead`/
`TableCell`, mirroring `admin-ui/src/index.css`'s `.data-table`/`.table-scroll` rules, plus design
tokens and 3 consumer migrations — consolidates what were #320+#321+#323 into one PR since they
all touched overlapping files; #321 closed in favor of this one), #323/#326/#327 (migrate
`entity-types/detail.tsx`, `workflows/detail.tsx`, `system-logs.tsx`, `users.tsx` — the 4
highest-regression-risk files — to the Table primitive, landed to `main` via #328), #329 (docs —
document the `[skip-tests-check]` exact-case-grep and PR-title-edit-doesn't-retrigger-CI gotchas,
found while retitling #328), #330 (export `TOKENS` from `packages/ui`'s `index.ts` — it existed
but was never exported, so migrated files kept hand-typing `var(--name, fallback)` strings, one of
which had drifted from the token's own corrected value; adds the `useHoverStyle` hook, explicitly
scoped in the PR title as "close the packages/ui #199 gap")
**Note:** despite #330's title, #199 itself wasn't actually closed at merge time — closed
retroactively 2026-08-07 after verifying the remaining useHoverStyle adoption (below) had also
landed. See this log's 2026-08-07 entry.

## 2026-08-04 — `dev:down`/`dev:reset` docker-compose wrappers

**Session type:** DX / bug fix
**PR merged:** #318, closes #202
**Summary:** `docker compose down` (keeps volumes) and `docker compose down -v` (wipes them) are
two easily-confused, opposite-implication destructive flags — flagged by the 2026-06-23
UX/adoption review as a product-level rough edge. Adds `pnpm dev:down` (alias) and `pnpm
dev:reset` (`scripts/dev-reset.sh`, requires typing `reset` to confirm) with intent-revealing names
instead of relying on the raw flags directly.

## 2026-08-04 — security batch B: outbound safety & PII protection

**Session type:** Security hardening
**PR merged:** #319, closes #246, #247, #248, #250
**Summary:** SSRF port allowlisting (destination ports restricted to `80, 443, 8080, 8443`);
webhook payload defaults changed to `includePayload: false` (opt-in) with a `sendFields` allowlist
filter stripping PII/sensitive data from `entity.created` trigger events unless explicitly
requested; notify-link SSRF and host validation fixes.

---

## 2026-08-03 — CI: conditional triggers + turbo-affected scoping

**Session type:** CI/infra
**PRs merged:** #324 (new `changes` job via `dorny/paths-filter`; `isolation-tests` skips on PRs
that don't touch `packages/db/**`/engine packages/`apps/**`/`tests/isolation/**`, still always
runs on `push` as a merge safety net; CodeQL skips similarly), #325 (stacked on #324 — scopes every
`turbo` invocation, not just whole jobs, to the packages the diff actually touches via a
`TURBO_FILTER` env var)
**Summary:** CI was running the full suite (tenant-isolation Postgres/Redis tests, CodeQL, all 28
workspace packages through every `turbo` command) on every push/PR regardless of what changed, so
a docs-only or UI-only PR paid the same cost as a `packages/db` change.

## 2026-08-03 — security(deps): brace-expansion GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895

**Session type:** Security dependency bump
**PR merged:** #322
**Summary:** New high-severity advisory (`CVE-2026-69152`) published 2026-08-03 bypassed the
existing `brace-expansion` `5.0.8` `maxLength` DoS mitigation — that fix only bounded the final
`combine()` step; two intermediate arrays built before it were never bounded, so a ~25KB input
still OOMs the process uncatchably. Patched in `5.0.9`. Discovered while investigating an unrelated
PR's CI failure on `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`. `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s override bumped from

## 2026-08-03 — fix flaky `api-key-auth.isolation.test.ts`

**Session type:** Test flake fix
**PR merged:** #316, closes #314
**Summary:** The isolation test read `lastUsedAt` once immediately after the request resolved,
with no synchronization point against `packages/auth/src/middleware.ts`'s intentionally
fire-and-forget write (from the #124 fix — don't block every authenticated request on a
best-effort timestamp write). Under CI load the test's read could run ahead of the write. Changed
to poll instead of racing it.

## 2026-08-03 — roadmap-tracker: fix stale PR #186/#188 row attribution

**Session type:** Docs reconciliation
**PRs merged:** #313, #315
**Summary:** Rows for #171/#182-185/#187/#150/#148/#110 still said "open, not yet merged" against
PR #186/#188 — both had merged 2026-07-25, and #182-185 had been miscredited to #188 across the
board when they were actually closed by #186. Corrected.

## 2026-08-03 — security batch 3 (PR #312): Group D follow-ups

**Session type:** Bug fix, security follow-up
**PR:** #312 — closes #306 (deduped tenant validation), #308 (export error mislabeling), #309
(unified `system.error` payload schemas), #310 (`initialState` delete guard), #311 (TOCTOU row
locking in `deleteWorkflowState`). #247 (notification HTML escaping) is explicitly **not** closed
by this PR — deferred to future outbound-HTML-email-sink work per the PR's own description.

## 2026-08-03 — issue hygiene (#284, #289, #301) + #303/#304 cleanup

**Session type:** Issue triage + bug fix (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-303-304-button-aschild-dialog-cleanup`
**Issues:** #284, #289, #301 (closed, no code — already shipped, just missing the closing
keyword), #303 and #304 (implemented and closed this session)

### Completed this session

- Checked 6 open issues (#284, #289, #296, #301, #303, #304) against their actual PR/merge
  state before doing any work, per the "verify before acting" discipline from the 2026-08-02
  session. Found 3 were already fully shipped to `main` but never auto-closed because their
  merging PRs (#298, #299, #302) didn't use a `Closes #N` keyword:
  - **#284** (a11y modal migration wave 2) — PR #298, merged 2026-08-03T05:13:53Z
  - **#289** (file/files field widgets) — PR #299, merged 2026-08-03T04:25:45Z
  - **#301** (`deleteWorkflowState` live-instance guard) — PR #302, merged 2026-08-03T08:15:03Z

  Closed all 3 with a comment linking the merge commit.

- **#296** (Postgres pool ceiling) left open — the issue itself states this needs a load-test
  target defined by a human before it's actionable, not something resolvable by reading code.
- Implemented the 2 remaining open issues, both non-blocking frontend cleanups flagged in PR
  review:
  - **#303** — added an `asChild` prop to `packages/ui`'s `Button` (Radix `Slot`, already a
    dependency but previously unused), migrated the 4 verified `<Link className="btn-secondary">`
    sites (one more than my first grep found — a wrapped `className` line hid 3 of them) to
    `<Button asChild variant="secondary"><Link>...</Link></Button>`.
  - **#304** — extracted the 19x-duplicated `DialogContent` style-reset block into an exported
    `DIALOG_CONTENT_RESET` constant in `packages/ui`; converted `modules.tsx`'s Preview and
    Fork/Copy-Template modals from conditional-mount to the controlled `open={x !== null}`
    pattern, converting ~18 `previewTarget.`/`forkTarget.` JSX references to optional chaining
    so the body renders safely while the dialog is closed.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (40/40 tasks)
- pnpm lint: PASS (40/40 tasks, `--max-warnings=0`)
- pnpm test: 8 pre-existing failures, all in `apps/api` isolation tests unrelated to this diff
  (same documented Docker-stack gap as PR #302 this week — missing PgBouncer/OpenBao/Zitadel
  containers in this sandbox)
- pnpm test:isolation: 7 pre-existing failures, same cause as above

### Next

- #296 needs a human-defined load-test target (concurrent tenants × req/s) before it can be
  picked up.

## 2026-08-03 — roadmap-tracker.md + pending-review-findings.md reconciliation

**Session type:** Docs reconciliation (no source changes)
**Branch:** `docs/PLAT-roadmap-reconciliation-0803`

Both tracker docs had drifted from actual `gh` state — a 2026-08-01 snapshot was already stale by
2026-08-03, and after merging `main` back in, a second pass caught `main`'s own docs commit making
the same kind of mistake (Group D's issue list in `roadmap-tracker.md` dropped #227/#249; PR #312
was wrongly credited with closing #247 despite its own body saying otherwise). Fixed both.

- `pending-review-findings.md`: deleted rows for closed issues per the doc's own stated rule
  (delete, don't mark done); reframed #192/#198 from "needs a person" to "open by deliberate
  maintainer decision"; corrected #200 from "untouched" — PR #272 shipped i18n scaffolding + 2
  converted screens 2026-07-31, ~55 files still remain.
- `roadmap-tracker.md`: cut the header's cascading multi-week "Previously:" narrative down to a
  current-state summary — that history already lives here, session by session; duplicating it in
  the tracker's header was pure drift risk with no reader benefit.
- Cross-referenced every branch left on disk against `gh pr list --state merged` as a side effect;
  found and deleted 41 fully-merged local branches (10 true git-ancestors, 31 squash-merged) plus
  30 remote branches on `origin`, none of which had a live worktree or unique unmerged content.

### Next

- #165/#163/#161 (module-registry cluster) is unstarted, informally assigned to Tushar Sharma via
  issue-comment `@mentions` — no PR yet.

## 2026-08-02 — issue hygiene sweep: #192, #194, #198

**Session type:** Issue triage (no source changes)
**Issues:** #194 (closed), #192 and #198 (verified, left open with status comments)

### Completed this session

- Verified 3 issues flagged as candidates for closure against their merged PRs' actual bodies
  rather than assuming "PR merged" = "issue resolved":
  - **#192** (backup runbook) — PR #286 merged, but its own description explicitly reserves the
    issue for a maintainer RPO/RTO + cron-schedule decision. Left open, no change needed (already
    accurately represented).
  - **#194** (e2e harness) — PR #287 merged and satisfies the issue's own stated completion bar
    ("even one real passing e2e spec"). Closed with a comment noting broader coverage remains an
    unscoped, available follow-on.
  - **#198** (modal a11y, systemic) — wave 1 (#285) merged but wave 2 (#284/PR #298) is still
    open/unmerged, so the issue's systemic bar isn't met yet. Left open with a status comment
    (not closed) pointing at the 2 explicitly-deferred items once #298 lands.

### Next

- Revisit #198 once PR #298 merges — likely closeable then, modulo the 2 deferred items.

## 2026-08-02 — #62 closed, real gap split to #301 and fixed

**Session type:** Bug fix (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-62-state-delete-instance-guard`
**Issues:** #62 (closed), #301 (filed and closed by this session's fix)

### Completed this session

- Re-investigated #62 ("workflow version GC and stuck instance recovery") now that the workflow
  editor (2D) has shipped. Its premise doesn't match the architecture that was actually built:
  no `version` column exists on `workflows`, and `deleteWorkflow` already blocks deletion when
  ANY instance references it (not just active ones) — so the "old version orphans instances"
  scenario the issue described can't happen. Closed #62 with the full explanation.
- Found a real, narrower, analogous gap while investigating: `deleteWorkflowState`
  (`packages/workflow-engine/src/workflow-crud.ts`) only checked whether a _transition_
  referenced the state being deleted — never whether a live entity instance was currently
  _sitting in_ it. `entityInstances.currentState` is a plain `text` column with no FK, so nothing
  at the DB layer caught this either. Filed as #301 with an accurate description.
- Followed the Prove-It Pattern: wrote a failing isolation test first
  (`apps/api/tests/isolation/workflow-state-delete-guard.isolation.test.ts`), confirmed it failed
  against unmodified code (the state got deleted despite a live instance sitting in it), then
  fixed `deleteWorkflowState` to also check `entityInstances` for the workflow + state name,
  throwing the same `WORKFLOW_STATE_IN_USE` error code (same underlying concept — a second kind
  of "in use"). Confirmed the fix doesn't regress deleting a genuinely unused state.
- Addressed PrabhuVijit's PR #302 review: broadened the `WORKFLOW_STATE_IN_USE` error message to
  cover both causes, wrapped every isolation-test `deleteWorkflowState` call in `withTenantContext`
  so RLS actually activates, added a cross-tenant isolation test, and collapsed a double
  `deleteWorkflowState` invocation in test case 1 down to one call.

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` — green, repo-wide.
- New isolation test: 3/3 pass (all wrapped in `withTenantContext`, including the added
  cross-tenant case). Existing `workflow-engine.isolation.test.ts`: 18/18 pass (run together with
  the new file).
- `pnpm test:isolation` — 8 pre-existing failures (api-keys CRUD, Redis-dependent), confirmed via
  `git stash` to be identical with or without this change — the sandbox's `ow-cache` container has
  no host-mapped port, unrelated to this diff.

## 2026-08-02 — #199 PR review fixes (PrabhuVijit)

**Session type:** Review response (same branch, `feat/PLAT-199-button-primitive`)
**Issues:** #199 (PR #295)

### Completed this session

- Addressed PrabhuVijit's PR #295 review: `IconButton.baseStyle` was missing 3 properties the
  original `.icon-btn` CSS had — `flexShrink: 0` (blocking; without it, icon buttons in
  space-constrained flex rows could shrink below their intended 30×30 size — confirmed at least
  one call site had already worked around it locally rather than at the source), `padding: 0`,
  and `outline: "none"` (prevents a double focus indicator now that a custom box-shadow ring
  drives focus styling). All three added.
- Added the same keyboard focus indicator to `Button` (it only existed on `IconButton` before) —
  `onFocus`/`onBlur` + box-shadow ring, `outline: "none"` on the base style.
- Added missing `aria-label` to the 4 flagged `IconButton` usages in
  `automations/wizard/step-conditions.tsx`/`step-actions.tsx`.
- Added the flagged test gap: primary/danger variant hover transitions, plus a `Button` focus-ring
  test.
- Filed **#303** for the "4 `<Link>` sites will drift from `Button`" follow-up (a real
  `asChild`/Radix-`Slot` design decision, not a quick fix) rather than fixing it in this pass.

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` — green, repo-wide.
- `pnpm --filter @platform/ui test` — 32/32 pass (up from 18, all new/updated tests included).
- `pnpm --filter @platform/admin-ui test` — 90/90 pass, no regressions.
- Still holding on the reviewer's recommended pre-merge human visual smoke test.

## 2026-08-01 — security group H: API route validation & RLS hardening

**Session type:** Security hardening (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-security-group-h`
**PR:** #294
**Issues:** #251, #252, #253, #260, #261, #263

### Completed this session

- **#263** added `WITH CHECK` to RLS policies on `access_requests`, `notifications`, `notification_recipients`, and `ticket_alerts` (migration `0048`).
- **#252** modified ticket alert endpoints to return 404 instead of 403 on existence checks to prevent resource ID enumeration.
- **#253** modified workflow canvas routes to return 404 instead of 403 when not a workflow admin to prevent ID leakage.
- **#260** added `requireRole("admin", "agent", "user")` check to 9 entity action endpoints that were missing role-based checks.
- **#261** capped API endpoints at max 500 rows and added limit/offset support to lists.
- **#251** added `PLATFORM_ORG_ID` environment check to tenant lifecycle routes to ensure tenant-admin boundaries.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS
- pnpm lint: PASS
- Added unit tests for each vulnerability and updated existing canvas/ticket-alerts isolation tests.
- All unit + integration tests pass successfully.

## 2026-08-01 — packages/ui: Button/IconButton primitive (#199)

**Session type:** Frontend architecture (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `feat/PLAT-199-button-primitive`
**Issues:** #199

### Completed this session

- Investigated #199 ("`packages/ui` is hollow") and found the premise partly stale: `Dialog`/
  `AlertDialog` (#273) and the `FieldInput`/`UserRefPicker`/`EntityRefPicker` consolidation (#288)
  were already correctly layered — generic Radix-based primitives in `packages/ui`, admin-ui-
  specific widgets (tied to entity-engine field types and API routes) staying in
  `apps/admin-ui/src/components/`, per the dependency rule. Moving the latter into `packages/ui`
  would have been the wrong fix.
- The real remaining gap: no `Button` primitive, despite 17 admin-ui pages each hand-rolling
  `<button className="btn-primary/btn-secondary/btn/btn-sm/btn-danger-sm/icon-btn-*">` against
  hand-written CSS in `index.css`. Added `Button` (variant: primary/secondary/danger, size:
  default/sm) and `IconButton` (variant: default/edit/delete/ghost) to `packages/ui`, styled with
  inline `React.CSSProperties` referencing the same design tokens `Dialog` already established
  (no CSS/asset pipeline in this package) — hover/focus/active state tracked via local React state
  since inline styles can't express pseudo-classes.
- Migrated all 17 identified pages (dispatched as 5 parallel subagent groups, each on disjoint
  files to avoid conflicting edits). ~136 button call sites converted. Deferred, unchanged:
  `btn-icon`/`btn-edit-sm` (1 usage each, ambiguous one-offs — same precedent as #288 deferring
  `file`/`files` widgets) and 4 `<Link>` elements styled as buttons (`Button` renders `<button>`,
  not `<a>` — out of scope for a className swap).
- Removed the now-dead `.btn`/`.btn-primary`/`.btn-primary-sm`/`.btn-sm`/`.btn-danger-sm`/
  `.icon-btn*` CSS rules from `index.css`. Kept `.btn-secondary` (still used by the 4 `<Link>`s),
  `.btn-icon`/`.btn-edit-sm` (deferred). One disclosed, intentional visual change: two divergent
  "small primary button" CSS rules existed pre-change (`.btn-primary-sm` vs `.btn-primary.btn-sm`,
  different padding) — `Button` implements one canonical version, same precedent as #288's
  currency-field consolidation note.

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` — green repo-wide, except 5 pre-existing
  `apps/api` isolation-test failures confirmed identical on a clean `main` checkout (this sandbox's
  Docker stack is only partially up — Postgres/Redis/MinIO running, no PgBouncer/OpenBao/Zitadel/
  worker containers — unrelated to this frontend-only diff).
- `pnpm test:isolation` — same pre-existing environmental gap, not run to completion; blocker
  surfaced rather than silently skipped, per `definition-of-done.md`.
- New `packages/ui` tests: `button.test.tsx` (9 tests), `icon-button.test.tsx` (9 tests) — both
  green. `apps/admin-ui`'s existing 90-test suite still green (14 files).
- No full-browser visual smoke test was possible in this sandbox (no `chromium-cli`/Playwright
  available, no network to install one, no Zitadel container for an authenticated session) —
  substituted with: dev server boots clean, all migrated page modules transform through Vite's
  dev pipeline without error, and manual diff review of every migrated file.

### Next

- #199 remains open for a `Table`/design-token layer if/when a second consuming app exists
  (`apps/portal` was removed in PR #211 — currently only one frontend app).

## 2026-08-02 — #284 PR review fixes (PrabhuVijit)

**Session type:** Review response (same branch, `fix/PLAT-284-modal-a11y-wave2`)
**Issues:** #284 (PR #298)

### Completed this session

- Addressed PrabhuVijit's PR #298 review: all ~20 custom `<DialogClose asChild>` close buttons
  (`<button className="modal-close">×</button>`) were missing `aria-label="Close"` — screen
  readers announced the `×` glyph literally instead of "Close". Added to all of them across
  `workflows/detail.tsx`, `record-detail.tsx`, `entity-types/*`, `instance-detail.tsx` (blocking).
- Also added the non-blocking `type="button"` suggestion to the same 14 buttons that were missing
  it (some already had it).
- Filed **#304** for the two remaining non-blocking suggestions (a shared `DIALOG_CONTENT_RESET`
  constant for the ~20-times-duplicated style-reset block, and converting `modules.tsx`'s two
  modals from conditional-mount to the controlled `open`/`onOpenChange` pattern used everywhere
  else) — the second one touches ~14 `previewTarget.`/`forkTarget.` references and deserves its
  own careful pass rather than being rushed into this response.

### Verification

- `pnpm --filter @platform/admin-ui typecheck && lint && test` — green (90/90 tests).

---

## 2026-08-02 — #284 a11y wave 2: migrate remaining modals to Dialog/AlertDialog

**Session type:** Frontend a11y (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-284-modal-a11y-wave2`
**Issues:** #284

### Completed this session

- Migrated 24 of the ~27 remaining single-instance modals (wave 1, #198/PR #285, consolidated
  the 2 duplicated patterns) from hand-rolled `.modal-overlay`/`.modal` divs to `@platform/ui`'s
  `Dialog`/`AlertDialog`, using the exact style-reset technique `transition-modal.tsx` already
  established — zero visual change, real `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`/focus-trap gained. Split
  across 4 files: `workflows/detail.tsx` (7), `customer/record-detail.tsx` (8),
  `workflow-canvas.tsx` + `modules.tsx` (4), `entity-types/*` + `record-list.tsx` (5).
- Deferred, unchanged: `workflow-canvas.tsx`'s `TransitionPanel` (a slide-in side panel, not a
  true modal) and `record-detail.tsx`'s access-denied overlay (a full-page state) — both
  explicitly flagged in the issue as needing separate manual judgment.
- De-duplicated a near-duplicate "Request access?" confirmation that had been split into two
  copies (one standalone modal, one embedded inside the access-denied overlay) purely to dodge a
  z-index/stacking bug — now that the standalone copy is a portal-based `Dialog`, the embedded
  copy was redundant and removed.
- **Found and fixed a real bug while doing this**: `packages/ui`'s `DialogContent` unconditionally
  renders its own "×" close button, even when a modal's own markup already supplies one —
  producing two close affordances. This was already live in production via `transition-modal.tsx`
  (wave 1, PR #285, 2 shipped instances) but wave 2 was about to propagate it to ~22 more. Added
  an opt-out `showCloseButton?: boolean` prop (default `true`, preserving existing behavior for
  callers with no close control of their own) and set it `false` on every migrated modal that has
  its own.

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` — green repo-wide.
- `pnpm --filter @platform/ui test` — 10/10 pass (this branch predates #199's Button/IconButton
  work, so only `dialog`/`alert-dialog` tests exist here; added a new test for `showCloseButton`).
- `pnpm --filter @platform/admin-ui test` — 90/90 pass, no regressions.
- Manual diff review of all 4 migration groups plus the `showCloseButton` fix.
- No full-browser visual check possible in this sandbox (same environment gap as the #199
  session) — substituted with jsdom component tests + manual diff review.

### Next

- `TransitionPanel` and the access-denied overlay remain open for a future, separately-scoped
  manual-judgment pass.

## 2026-08-02 — #289 PR review fixes (PrabhuVijit)

**Session type:** Review response (same branch, `feat/PLAT-289-file-field-widgets`)
**Issues:** #289 (PR #299)

### Completed this session

- Addressed PrabhuVijit's PR #299 review, both required bugs:
  - **Visual duplicate in edit mode**: once a staged upload's id also appeared in
    `existingFiles` (the entity's attachment list, fetched after `POST /files` associated the
    file), both `StagedFileChip` and `FileChip` rendered for the same file. Fixed by filtering
    `stagedFiles` to exclude ids already present in `existingFiles` before rendering.
  - **`cleanFileIds` effect fired on every render**: `cleanFileIds` is a fresh array reference
    each render (computed inline in `useFileUpload`), so `useEffect(..., [cleanFileIds])` never
    actually skipped a render. Changed to `[cleanFileIds.join(",")]`, matching the same pattern
    already used one effect above for `currentIds`.
- Also addressed all 3 "recommended before merge" items: a single-mode race guard (block a
  second upload from starting while the first is still mid-scan), an inline comment on the
  `fetchWithAuth` return-type assertion (code-style rule), and converting the two structural
  layout `<div style={{...}}>`s to CSS classes (`ffp-container`/`ffp-chip-row` in `index.css`,
  matching `file-attachment.tsx`'s `fa-*` convention).
- Added the requested test confirming `StagedFileChip` is suppressed once the same id appears in
  `existingFiles`.

### Verification

- `pnpm --filter @platform/admin-ui typecheck && lint && test` — green (101/101 tests, up from
  100).
- **Caught and reverted a mistake in this session**: ran `prettier --write` on the whole
  `apps/admin-ui/src/index.css` to format the 2 new CSS classes, not realizing this project's
  `format:check` only covers `.ts/.tsx/.md/.json` (not `.css`) — it rewrote ~4000 unrelated lines
  across the entire file. Reverted immediately via `git checkout`, re-added just the 2 intended
  lines by hand.

## 2026-08-02 — #289 file/files field-type widgets for FieldInput

**Session type:** Frontend feature (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `feat/PLAT-289-file-field-widgets`
**Issues:** #289

### Completed this session

- Added `FileFieldPicker` (`apps/admin-ui/src/components/file-field-picker.tsx`) — a
  self-fetching widget for `file`/`files` fields, mirroring the `UserRefPicker`/`EntityRefPicker`
  pattern (#197/PR #288): `useFileUpload` calls hooks internally, so it must live in its own
  component mounted from `FieldInput`'s switch, never inline in a switch case. Reuses the
  existing upload flow end-to-end — `useFileUpload`, `AttachmentUploadZone`, `StagedFileChip`,
  `FileChip`, `FilePreviewModal` — no new upload/scan logic.
- Wired `case "file"`/`case "files"` into `field-input.tsx` (`multiple` derived from
  `field.fieldType`), replacing the previous silent fallthrough to a plain, freely-editable text
  input — the bug #289 exists to fix.
- Threaded the new required `moduleSlug`/`entityId` props through all 4 `FieldInput` call sites.
  `record-detail.tsx`/`record-create.tsx` already computed a `moduleSlug` for their own
  attachments section — reused directly. `instance-detail.tsx`/`instance-create.tsx` had no such
  concept before (entity types can have `moduleId: null` for core/module-less types) — added a
  `modules.find(m => m.id === type?.moduleId)?.slug ?? "platform"` derivation via
  `useEntityTypes()`.
- Field-level "remove" only clears the field's own reference (`onChange`) — it never deletes the
  underlying file record, since the same file may legitimately still appear in the entity's
  general attachments list (confirmed `GET /entities/:id/attachments` is generic,
  entity-engine-level, not module-specific).

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` — green.
- `pnpm --filter @platform/admin-ui test` — 100/100 pass (10 new: 8 `file-field-picker.test.tsx`
  - 2 new `field-input.test.tsx` cases for the `file`/`files` delegation).
- No full-browser visual check possible in this sandbox (same environment gap as the #199/#284
  sessions) — substituted with component tests + manual diff review.

## 2026-08-01 — #196 perf scale-risk backlog: closed

**Session type:** Investigation / issue triage (no source changes)
**Issues:** #196 (closed), #296 (filed)

### Completed this session

- Re-verified all 4 grouped sub-findings in #196 against current code (post the recent
  security-hardening PR batch, #279–#294), rather than trusting the 2026-07-31 investigation
  comment at face value:
  - Cross-instance cache invalidation — confirmed still doesn't reproduce.
    `schema-cache.ts`'s `invalidateSchemaCache` uses cursor-based `redis.scan` + `del`, not the
    blocking `redis.keys()` issue #4 separately tracks; `engine.ts`'s three `Map` caches are all
    function-local (recreated per call), not persistent cross-replica state.
  - `ts_rank` OFFSET pagination cliff — confirmed still doesn't reproduce, zero `OFFSET`/
    `.offset(` usage under `entity-engine/src`.
  - `bulkUpdateEntities` N+1 — already fixed via PR #271.
  - Connection pool ceiling (`DATABASE_POOL_MAX=10`) — genuinely not resolvable by code-reading;
    needs a real concurrency target + load test. Split into its own tracked issue, **#296**, per
    #196's own "suggested next step" (split once any item is confirmed/scoped).
- Closed #196 with the re-verification recorded as a comment.

### Next

- #296 stays open until a load-test session with a concrete concurrent-tenant target is run —
  matches CLAUDE.md's existing "deferred until load testing" gate for adjacent schema-cache work.

## 2026-08-01 — security group G: automation engine hardening + abmish review fixes

**Session type:** Security hardening (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-security-group-g`
**PR:** #293
**Issues:** #245, #228, #258, #256, #259, #257
**Skipped:** #246, #248, #250 — blocked on issue #2 (SSRF/PII), require human review

### Completed this session

- **#245** Fail-closed circuit breaker — throw `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_UNAVAILABLE` when redis is
  undefined instead of silently bypassing; running automation without a circuit breaker is worse
  than refusing to run. The executor catches this per-rule and marks the execution `failed`.
- **#228** Deterministic notify IDs — SHA-256 of `(tenantId, ruleId, jobEventId, recipientId)`
  formatted as a UUID v4-like string, plus `onConflictDoNothing` on both DB inserts. `jobEventId`
  is the outbox event row ID (= BullMQ `jobId`), which is constant across all retry attempts —
  not `execRow.id` which is freshly generated on each call (abmish finding #1). Threaded through
  `executeAutomationRules` → `runAction` → `executeNotifyAction` and through
  `executeTransitionAction`'s recursive call.
- **#258** Removed `OutboxDepthSchema.passthrough()` — Zod's default strip mode is correct.
- **#256** Unknown action type now throws `UNKNOWN_ACTION_TYPE` instead of silently no-op'ing.
  `connector.action` is now an explicit case that logs and no-ops gracefully — preserving
  existing stored rules without tripping the circuit breaker (abmish finding #4).
- **#259** Removed `script` action type from executor switch and API schemas.
- **#257** Per-trigger-type `triggerConfig` validation: partial PATCH now fetches the existing
  rule from DB to validate the config/type pair when only one half is patched (abmish finding #2).
  `TRIGGER_CONFIG_SCHEMAS` changed from `Partial<Record<...>>` to `Record<...>` for compile-time
  exhaustiveness (abmish finding #5). Wizard UI field names (`recipients`, `channels`, `message`)
  preserved in `NotifyConfigSchema` so they survive Zod's default strip (abmish finding #3).

## 2026-07-31 — open workflow visibility & ticket creation to all tenant users

**Session type:** New feature (not on the tracked #120–#129 backlog)
**Branch:** `tushar`

### Completed this session

- Spec + task plan: `docs/specs/workflow-open-ticket-creation.md`,
  `docs/specs/workflow-open-ticket-creation-tasks.md`. Previously only a
  workflow's `createdBy`/`assignedTo[]` admins (ADR-006's ownership model)
  could create tickets in it — `GET /workflows?entityTypeId=X` came back
  empty for every other tenant user, silently degrading the create-ticket
  form. Fix opens ticket-creation-purpose workflow resolution to any
  authenticated tenant user, while workflow settings/config
  (`PATCH`/`DELETE /admin/workflows/:id`) and the ownership-filtered
  workflow-management list stay exactly as gated.
- **`packages/workflow-engine/src/workflow-crud.ts`**: added a shared
  `visibilityFor()` helper applied to both `listWorkflows` and
  `listWorkflowsSummary` — drops the ownership filter only when
  `entityTypeId` is present (the ticket-creation-resolution shape), keeps it
  for bare calls (the management-list shape). Correction made mid-implementation:
  the spec initially assumed `listWorkflowsSummary` was the reachable
  function; tracing actual frontend call sites showed no caller ever passes
  `summary=true`, so both real-traffic paths (creation resolution and the
  management list) go through `listWorkflows` — fixed both functions
  identically. `getWorkflowByEntityTypeId` (a separate function backing
  field-schema-edit rights AND `GET /entities`'s list-privilege escalation)
  is untouched, with a regression test.
- **`apps/api/src/routes/entities/create.ts`**: `assignedTo` now validated
  against `listUserIdsWithRole(orgId, "user")` — same pool `GET
/platform/users` exposes — rejecting (422) a nonexistent id, an
  agent/admin account, or a cross-tenant id; fails closed if `orgId` is
  absent.
- **`packages/entity-engine/src/types.ts` + `engine.ts` + `apps/api/src/routes/entities/list.ts`**:
  fixed `GET /entities`'s non-privileged scoping, previously `assignedTo`
  only (so a user who created a ticket but wasn't its assignee lost track of
  it). New `ListEntitiesInput.scopeToUserId` field (engine) plus a route
  change to pass it instead of collapsing to `assignedTo: userId` — this was
  a two-file fix caught during the pre-implementation security pass (fixing
  only the engine side would have shipped a no-op, since the route never
  forwarded anything else). Preserves the existing "query param cannot
  override scope" property, with an explicit regression test.
- Pre-implementation `/security-review` pass (before any code was written)
  and a second review after implementation — no HIGH/MEDIUM findings either
  pass. STRIDE notes recorded in the spec (ticket-spam/DoS accepted as
  explicit out-of-scope; spoofing/repudiation/inappropriate-assignment
  closed by the `assignedTo` validation).

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (entity-engine, workflow-engine, api)
- pnpm lint: PASS (`--max-warnings=0`, same 3 packages)
- pnpm test: PASS — workflow-crud 9/9, entity-engine 191/191,
  workflow-engine 79/79, api 542/548 (6 pre-existing failures in
  `upload-flow`/`view-configs`/`modules` integration tests, confirmed via
  `git stash` to fail identically on the unmodified branch — unrelated
  missing test-DB/timeout issues, not caused by this change)
- pnpm test:isolation: PASS — 30 files, 207/207, run against a real
  `platform_test` Postgres DB (RLS on `workflows`/`workflow_states`/
  `workflow_transitions`/`entity_instances` unaffected)

### Next

- Commit + PR for this branch's workflow-access changes.

## 2026-07-27 — local-disk file storage (replace S3/MinIO)

**Session type:** New feature (not on the tracked #120–#129 backlog)
**Branch:** `media` (off `tushar`)

### Completed this session

- Spec + task plan: `docs/specs/local-disk-file-storage.md`,
  `docs/specs/local-disk-file-storage-tasks.md`. Replaces `@platform/files`'
  S3/MinIO backend — presigned URLs broke on the real server
  (`S3_PUBLIC_URL=localhost:9000` only resolves in local dev).
- **`packages/files`**: `saveUpload`/`getFileStream`/`deleteFile`/
  `deleteTenantFiles` replace `initiateUpload`/`confirmUpload`/
  `getDownloadUrl` — direct `fs` calls (temp-file-then-rename for atomic
  writes) instead of S3 SDK calls. Same quota/RLS/metadata model, unchanged.
- **API routes**: `POST /files` collapsed from a two-step
  initiate+presigned-PUT+complete flow into one multipart upload; `GET
/files/:id` now streams bytes directly (with the same tenant+entity-ACL
  gate) instead of redirecting to a presigned URL.
- **`apps/worker/src/av-scan.ts`**: streams the file from disk into ClamAV's
  INSTREAM protocol instead of downloading from S3 into a buffer first.
  `file-cleanup.ts`/`tenant-purge.ts` also switched from S3 deletes to
  `fs.unlink`/recursive `fs.rm`.
- **admin-ui**: upload hook (`use-file-upload.ts`) switched to one-shot
  multipart POST; download/preview code (`file-attachment.tsx`) switched
  from following a presigned URL to fetching bytes as a Blob (binary
  downloads now require the `Authorization` header, which plain
  `<img>`/`<embed>` src attributes can't send). A duplicated upload path in
  `record-detail.tsx`'s customer attachment uploader got the same fix, plus
  a poll-for-`clean`-before-attach fix — `POST /entities/:id/attachments`
  (which writes the `file_attached` history event) requires `scanStatus ===
"clean"`, but the frontend was calling it immediately after upload, before
  the async AV scan finished, so the history event silently 422'd and never
  got written even though the file itself already showed up in the
  attachment list.
- **Infra**: `docker-compose.yml`'s `minio`/`minio-init` commented out;
  `FILES_STORAGE_PATH_HOST` (new, defaults to `../openwind-files`, sibling
  to the repo checkout — same value works on a laptop or a server)
  bind-mounted into `ow-backend`/`ow-worker` at `/data/files`.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (packages/files, packages/config, apps/api,
  apps/worker, apps/admin-ui)
- pnpm test: PASS — packages/files (17), apps/worker (70), apps/api files
  unit tests (16) + integration tests (11, run against a real Redis/Postgres
  once the pre-existing `.env.local` `SKIP_AV_SCAN=true`/no-host-Redis-port
  local-dev quirks were worked around), apps/admin-ui (53)
- pnpm test:isolation: not re-run this session (no RLS/schema changes —
  `files` table untouched)
- Manual end-to-end: built and ran the full `docker compose up -d` stack;
  verified write→read-back→stream-download→delete→404-after-delete against
  the real running containers (real Postgres, real bind-mounted disk, real
  RLS), confirmed the bind-mount is visible on the host filesystem, and
  confirmed persistence across `docker compose down`/`up`. Also manually
  exercised upload/delete/history-timeline in the browser on the ticket
  detail page.
- One real bug caught and fixed mid-session: `saveUpload`'s `SKIP_AV_SCAN`
  dev-shortcut branch updated the `files` row without setting the RLS
  tenant-context GUC first (a regression from the old `confirmUpload`, which
  had that context already open in its own transaction) — fixed by wrapping
  it in a `db.transaction` with `set_config('app.tenant_id', ...)`.

### Next

- Not yet pushed/PR'd as of this entry — pending `git push` to `media`.
- `.env.server`/production deployment still needs `FILES_STORAGE_PATH_HOST`
  set (or left to its sibling-directory default) on the real server before
  the next deploy.

### Open questions

- None blocking.

## 2026-07-27 (later) — production deploy + a real pre-existing bug it exposed

**Session type:** Deploy of the above `media` branch to the `tushar` branch
and the production server, plus a follow-up fix

### Completed this session

- Merged `media` into `tushar` (fast-forward), pushed, deleted `media`.
- Deployed to the production server: `git pull`, rebuilt `ow-backend`,
  `ow-frontend`, **and `ow-worker`** (the existing `server-up.sh` script only
  rebuilds backend+frontend — had to run the `docker compose ... up -d
--build` command manually with `ow-worker` included, since our AV-scan/
  file-cleanup/tenant-purge changes live there). `--remove-orphans` cleanly
  removed the now-unmanaged MinIO containers; confirmed the bucket was empty
  first (`mc ls` — no migration needed).
- **Found and fixed a real pre-existing production bug**, exposed for the
  first time by this deploy: `apps/worker/src/av-scan.ts`'s DB queries (the
  idempotency-check select, both `clean`/`quarantined` status updates, and
  the failure-handler's update+outbox-insert) were bare `db.select()`/
  `update()`/`insert()` calls, never wrapped in `withTenantContext`. Against
  a real PgBouncer-pooled connection this throws `invalid input syntax for
type uuid: ""` — the RLS policy's `app.tenant_id` GUC was unset/stale, and
  casting the empty default to `uuid` fails outright (unlike a fresh direct
  psql connection, where an unset custom GUC just returns `NULL` and the
  query silently returns zero rows — which is why a manual `psql` repro
  didn't reproduce it and a from-inside-the-app repro script was needed to
  see the real `.cause`). This code was untouched by the S3→disk migration
  itself (same shape before and after) — it never surfaced before because
  uploads never reached the AV-scan queue under the old broken
  presigned-URL flow. Fixed by wrapping every DB call in `av-scan.ts` with
  `withTenantContext`, matching the convention everywhere else in the
  codebase (`tenant-purge.ts` already did this correctly).
- Logged as B1/B2 and promoted to a `§V` invariant in
  `docs/specs/local-disk-file-storage.md`: any bare `db` call in tenant-scoped
  worker code is a production bug, not just a lint nit — it breaks under
  PgBouncer transaction pooling even though it may look fine against a
  fresh, unpooled connection.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (apps/worker)
- pnpm test: PASS — apps/worker (70, including updated `av-scan.test.ts`
  mocking `withTenantContext`)
- Manual: reproduced the exact failing query through the app's own DB client
  inside the running `ow-worker` container on the server, confirmed the real
  `PostgresError` cause, applied the fix, rebuilt `ow-worker` again

### Next

- Re-test the full upload → scan → clean → timeline flow on the live server
  now that the worker fix is deployed.
- Consider fixing `av-scan.ts`'s (and other worker code's) error logging to
  include `err.cause`, not just `String(err)` — this bug's root cause was
  invisible in the app's own logs and required a manual repro script to see.

### Open questions

- None blocking.

## 2026-07-27 (later still) — ClamAV was never actually deployed anywhere

**Session type:** Infra gap fix, found while re-testing the worker fix above

### Completed this session

- After the `withTenantContext` fix (previous entry) deployed cleanly, the
  next upload attempt still failed — `av-scan: job failed` with
  `AggregateError` (a connection failure) on every retry. Root cause:
  **`docker-compose.yml` never had a ClamAV service at all** —
  `CLAMAV_HOST` defaults to `localhost`, which inside the worker container
  resolves to nothing. `SKIP_AV_SCAN=true` was briefly considered as a
  quick unblock, but `packages/config/src/env.ts` has a deliberate
  production guard (`.refine(...)`) that refuses to boot if
  `SKIP_AV_SCAN=true` and `NODE_ENV=production` — written specifically to
  stop antivirus scanning from being silently disabled in production.
  Since the server's containers do run with `NODE_ENV=production`, that
  path was a dead end anyway, and disabling AV scanning for uploaded ticket
  attachments isn't something to route around lightly.
- Added a real `clamav` service (`clamav/clamav:stable`) to
  `docker-compose.yml`, wired `ow-worker` to depend on it
  (`condition: service_healthy`) and point `CLAMAV_HOST`/`CLAMAV_PORT` at
  it. Confirmed server has 62GB RAM / 51GB available / 16 cores — plenty of
  headroom for ClamAV's ~1GB footprint. `start_period: 300s` on its
  healthcheck since first boot downloads the virus signature DB
  (freshclam), which can take a few minutes.
- This closes a gap that predates the S3→disk migration entirely — AV
  scanning was designed into the system (`av-scan.ts`, the `scanStatus`
  state machine, the download gate) but never actually had a scanner to
  talk to in this deployment, on either the server or (via `SKIP_AV_SCAN`)
  local dev.

### Verification

- `docker compose config --quiet`: PASS (compose file is syntactically
  valid with the new service)
- Pending: deploy to server, confirm ClamAV container reaches healthy,
  confirm a fresh upload reaches `scanStatus: "clean"` end-to-end

### Next

- Deploy: `git pull` + rebuild `ow-worker` (no other service needs
  rebuilding) on the server, wait for `ow-clamav` to report healthy
  (can take a few minutes on first boot), re-test upload.

## 2026-07-31 — #191–#202 batch triage: 5 PRs (backup/DR, e2e harness, field widgets, a11y modals wave 1, confirm/alert dialog)

**Session type:** Backlog triage + fixes (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship, one plan-lock/PR per issue)
**Branches:** `fix/PLAT-201-confirm-alert-dialog`, `fix/PLAT-198-a11y-modals`,
`chore/PLAT-192-backup-runbook`, `test/PLAT-194-e2e-harness-mvp`, `feat/PLAT-197-field-type-widgets`
**Issues:** #201, #198, #192, #194, #197 (all part of the #191–#202 second consulting-review batch)

### Completed this session

- **#201** (PR #282): replaced native `confirm()`/`alert()` at 8 call sites with a shared
  `GlobalAlertDialog` (window `CustomEvent` controller, mirrors the existing
  `global-error-banner.tsx` pattern) built on `@platform/ui`'s `AlertDialog` primitive. Found and
  fixed a double-fire bug along the way: `AlertDialogCancel` auto-triggers `onOpenChange(false)`,
  so an explicit `onClick` alongside it called `onCancel` twice.
- **#198** (PR #285, wave 1 of N): consolidated the first 2 duplicated modal patterns —
  `ConfirmDeleteDialog` (replaces 5 hand-rolled copies) and `TransitionModal` (replaces 2
  byte-for-byte-identical ~161-line components). Filed **#284** documenting the remaining ~27
  single-instance modals as a follow-up rather than scope-creeping this PR.
- **#192** (PR #286): finished the backup runbook — verified end-to-end against the real stack
  (uploaded a test file to MinIO, ran the backup, confirmed checksum match; restored the Postgres
  dump into a scratch DB, confirmed table/row counts matched source exactly). Documented scope
  (Postgres + MinIO backed up; Redis/Mongo deliberately not) in `docs/local-setup.md`.
- **#194** (PR #287): stood up `tests/e2e/` with one real MVP flow (module install →
  view-config seeding), and — in the process — discovered every existing "integration" test in
  this repo mocks `@platform/auth` entirely, so no test had ever exercised the real
  `requireAuth`/`requireRole` chain. This one uses a real `api_keys` DB row and real HTTP auth.
  Also fixed a real (if narrow) gap while here: `apps/api/vitest.config.ts`'s module-alias map was
  missing `@platform/redis`, the actual root cause of an unrelated CJS/ESM resolution failure.
- **#197** (PR #288): consolidated the 4 duplicated `FieldInput` implementations into one shared
  component; added real widgets for `user_ref` (reuses the existing `UserPicker`) and `entity_ref`
  (new searchable picker, resolves `config.target_entity_type` via `useEntityTypes()`); `formula`/
  `lookup` render read-only (confirmed both are computed server-side). `file`/`files` deferred as
  **#289** — the upload API's required `moduleSlug` param doesn't fit a generic, page-agnostic
  component.
- **#149** and **#218** closed earlier in this session (PRs #269, #270); **#196** investigated —
  2 of 4 sub-findings don't reproduce against current code, 1 fixed via PR #271.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (repo-wide, all 40 tasks)
- pnpm lint: PASS (repo-wide, `--max-warnings=0`)
- pnpm test: PASS — 589/596, 6 skipped; 2 pre-existing failures (`quarantine-flow.test.ts`,
  `upload-flow.test.ts`, both Redis `ECONNREFUSED` — this repo's dev compose doesn't map Redis to
  a host port — confirmed pre-existing, not introduced by this session's changes)
- pnpm test:isolation: PASS (33/33 files, 217/217 tests)
- `vite build`: clean production build for admin-ui after each UI change

### Next

- #199 (`packages/ui` hollow) and #200 (zero i18n) remain untouched — still open, unassigned.
- #284 (remaining ~27 modals) and #289 (`file`/`files` widgets) filed as explicit follow-ups.
- #196 left open pending a decision on the connection-pool-sizing sub-finding (the only one of the
  4 not fully resolved or dismissed).
- 5 PRs open awaiting human review: #282, #285, #286, #287, #288.

### Open questions

- None blocking. All 5 PRs document their scope decisions (deferred file/files, modal wave 1,
  pool-sizing) directly in their PR bodies / filed follow-up issues rather than leaving them
  implicit.

## 2026-07-31 — security group B: four critical API access control fixes

**Session type:** Security hardening (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-security-hardening`
**Issues:** #225, #223, #229, #231
**Spec:** `docs/specs/security-group-b-api-access-control.md`

### Completed this session

- **#225** (critical): `viewConfigsRouter` was registered before `adminRouter` in `app.ts` —
  Hono first-match wins, so `GET /admin/view-configs/:entityType` was handled by the router that
  only had `requireAuth()` (no `requireRole()`), making it readable by any authenticated user.
  Fixed by adding `requireRole("agent", "admin")` to the GET handler directly.
- **#223** (critical): `POST /api-keys` accepted arbitrary `scopes` including `"superadmin"` from
  an `admin`-role caller. Fixed by validating requested scopes are a subset of the creator's own
  JWT roles before inserting the key.
- **#229** (critical): `POST /entities` and `POST /entities/bulk` accepted `createdBy` from the
  request body. Any `user`-role caller could attribute an entity to another user and gain implicit
  `read_write` access via the `createdBy === userId` access shortcut. Fixed by stripping `createdBy`
  from both schemas; the authenticated `userId` is now always used.
- **#231** (critical): `GET/PATCH /admin/platform-settings` required only `requireRole("admin")`,
  but `platform_settings` is a global singleton (not tenant-scoped). Any tenant admin could
  toggle the outbound notifications kill-switch platform-wide. Fixed to `requireRole("superadmin")`.
  Updated existing isolation test to match.

**Tests:** 23 new unit tests across 4 new test files; existing isolation test updated.
**Result:** 347/347 unit tests passing; typecheck + lint clean.

## 2026-07-31 — Security Group C: file route hardening (#224, #235, #239, #240, #241)

**Session type:** Security fix (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-security-group-c`
**Issues:** #224, #235, #239, #240, #241

### Completed this session

- **#224 / #239** (`download.ts`, `status.ts`): Unbound files (entityId = null) skipped all ACL
  checks — any authenticated tenant member who knew a fileId could obtain a presigned download URL
  for another user's unattached file. Added uploader-ownership check (`uploadedBy === userId`) for
  files not yet bound to an entity; admin/agent roles bypass as expected.
- **#235** (`delete.ts`): `DELETE /files/:id` called `deleteFile(db, ...)` with the raw module-level
  `db` handle, bypassing `withTenantContext`. RLS second layer (ADR-001) was absent on the only
  mutating file route. Wrapped in `withTenantContext`.
- **#240** (`packages/files/src/index.ts` — `getDownloadUrl`): SVG files served with
  `Content-Disposition: inline` are executed as JavaScript in the browser's page origin — stored-XSS
  via crafted SVG upload. Force attachment regardless of the caller's inline flag when
  `mimeType === 'image/svg+xml'`.
- **#241** (`packages/files/src/index.ts` — `getDownloadUrl`): Raw `originalName` embedded in
  `Content-Disposition` allowed header injection (`\r\n`), early value termination (`"`), and
  Unicode bidi-override spoofing. Sanitized the ASCII fallback and added RFC 5987 `filename*`
  encoding for Unicode filenames.

**Tests:** 18 new tests across `files.test.ts`, `status.test.ts`, `packages/files/src/index.test.ts`.
332/332 unit tests passing. Typecheck + lint clean.

## 2026-07-31 — Group E: withTenantContext gaps in worker + routes (#243 #244 #254 #234)

**Session type:** Security hardening (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-security-group-e`
**Spec:** `docs/specs/group-e-withtenant-context-gaps.md`

### Completed this session

- **#243 sla-breacher bare db**: Both the main processor and the dead-letter failed handler
  replaced `db.transaction()` + manual `set_config` with `withTenantContext(tenantId, tx => ...)`.
  RLS second layer now enforced on `outbox_events`, `entity_instances`, and `dead_letter_events`.
- **#244 sla-scheduler no role switch**: The dead-letter loop inside `tick()` already used
  `set_config` but not `SET LOCAL ROLE app_user`. Added `await tx.execute(sql\`SET LOCAL ROLE app_user\`)`before each tenant's`set_config`call. Cannot use`withTenantContext`here because the outer`db.transaction()` with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED must remain a single atomic transaction.
- **#254 notification prefs bare db**: `apps/api/src/routes/preferences/notifications.ts` — both
  GET and PATCH replaced bare `db` calls with `withTenantContext`.
- **#234 entity-type GET/list routes bare db**: `apps/api/src/routes/entity-types/get.ts` and
  `list.ts` both updated to route through `withTenantContext`.
- Tests: `sla-breacher.test.ts` mock structure replaced (`db.transaction` → `withTenantContext`),
  assertions updated. `sla-scheduler.test.ts` updated to assert two execute calls per tenant
  (SET LOCAL ROLE + set_config). New test files: `preferences/notifications.test.ts`,
  `entity-types/get.test.ts`, `entity-types/list.test.ts`.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (all packages)
- pnpm lint: PASS

## 2026-07-31 — #195 closed: post-auth tenant-scoped rate limiting

**Session type:** Investigation + bug fix (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-195-tenant-rate-limit`
**Issue:** #195
**Spec:** `docs/specs/tenant-scoped-rate-limit-195.md`

### Completed this session

- Investigated the `loadEntityType()` defense-in-depth finding surfaced during #191's review
  (missing explicit tenant filter, relying solely on RLS). Confirmed it's not currently
  exploitable — RLS on `entity_types` since ADR-007 already blocks the cross-tenant case for every
  real call path — but is a genuine violation of this repo's "two layers, always" rule. Filed as
  **#220** rather than silently absorbed, so it doesn't rot unfiled.
- **#195**: `apps/api`'s pre-auth rate-limit middleware ran before `requireAuth()`, so its
  "prefer verified auth" branch was permanently dead code; its fallback decoded (never verified) a
  bearer token's `org`/`sub` claim and bucketed on it, letting a client evade its limit entirely by
  varying an unverified claim per request.
  - Pre-auth stage simplified to key strictly on client IP — no token content read at all.
  - New post-auth, tenant-scoped stage added inside `requireAuth()` (`@platform/auth`), both the
    JWT and API-key paths, keyed on the verified `auth.tenantId` — unforgeable by construction.
    100 req/min default (`RATE_LIMIT_TENANT_PER_MIN`, matches `security.md`'s documented default).
  - Both stages share one sliding-window Redis implementation, moved to `@platform/redis`
    (`packages/redis/src/rate-limit.ts`) rather than duplicated.
  - **Correctness fix found via runtime testing, not assumed**: the original design assumed
    "fails open on Redis error" the way the pre-auth stage's own code comment implied — but
    verifying against this repo's actual Redis container (no host port mapping by design) showed
    ioredis queues commands while disconnected rather than rejecting fast, so an unreachable Redis
    would hang a request for many seconds instead of failing open. Fixed by wrapping the shared
    `checkRateLimit` in a bounded 250ms timeout that always resolves (never throws), verified with
    a real hung-pipeline test that measures elapsed time.
- Prove-It confirmed throughout: new tests in `rate-limit.test.ts` (both `apps/api` and
  `@platform/redis`) and `middleware.test.ts` fail against the pre-fix code (checked via
  `git stash`), pass after.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (all 28 packages)
- pnpm lint: PASS
- pnpm test: 2 pre-existing failures (`quarantine-flow.test.ts`, `upload-flow.test.ts` — both
  ioredis "Connection is closed" against a Redis this host can't reach), confirmed pre-existing via
  `git stash` comparison against the base commit; unrelated files, not touched by this diff
- pnpm test:isolation: PASS (26/26 files, 185/185 tests, including 2 extended with new cases)

### Next

- #191–#202 (second consulting-review batch, filed 2026-07-24) still mostly open/unassigned.
- #218 (create_entity recursion-depth gap) and #220 (loadEntityType tenant-filter gap) both need
  a human-approved plan-lock before pickup — both change an entity-engine package contract.

### Open questions

- None blocking. Flagged in the spec: the post-auth limit is a flat 100/min regardless of route —
  route-class-aware post-auth limits are a possible follow-up if that proves too coarse in practice.

## 2026-07-30 — #191 closed: automation `assign`/`create_entity` actions wired up

**Session type:** Bug fix (Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship)
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-191-automation-assign-create-entity`
**Issue:** #191

### Completed this session

- `packages/automation-engine/src/executor.ts`'s `runAction` switch had no case for `assign` or
  `create_entity` — both were declared in the `ActionType` union (selectable in the no-code
  automation builder, usable in module seed SQL) but silently no-opped. Added:
  - `actions/assign.ts` — calls `updateEntity({ assignedTo })`, mirroring `set-field.ts`'s
    instanceId-resolution and depth-threading pattern.
  - `actions/create-entity.ts` — calls `createEntity` with a configured `entityTypeId`/`fields`.
- Replaced the two `Record<string, unknown>` placeholder shapes in `ActionConfig` (types.ts) and
  `ActionConfigSchema` (apps/api's automation-rules/schemas.ts) with real typed/Zod shapes now
  that they're implemented.
- Prove-It: added failing tests first (confirmed via `git stash` on the implementation files that
  they fail on pre-fix code), then implemented, then confirmed green.
- New isolation test (`automation-assign-create-entity.isolation.test.ts`) runs both actions
  end-to-end through a real automation rule against Postgres.
- **Filed #218 as a follow-up, not fixed here:** wiring up `create_entity` makes a previously
  theoretical gap live — `buildEntityCreatedPayload` (entity-engine) has no `depth` parameter,
  unlike `buildEntityAssignedPayload` (which #120/PR#139 fixed), so a self-triggering
  `create_entity` rule recurses unbounded across the outbox hop instead of hitting `MAX_DEPTH`.
  Fixing it changes `CreateEntityInput`'s shape — an entity-engine API change out of #191's scope.
  Not blocking on it: `create_entity` ships inert in every existing module seed today.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (all 28 packages, after rebuilding several packages' stale `dist/` —
  pre-existing staleness from the 58-commit pull earlier this session, not caused by this diff)
- pnpm lint: PASS
- pnpm test: 10 pre-existing failures in `modules.test.ts`/`upload-flow.test.ts`/
  `view-configs.test.ts` (freshly-created local `platform_test` DB missing seed data, and Redis
  unreachable from host per the port-mapping removal) — confirmed pre-existing via `git stash`
  comparison against the base commit; unrelated files, not touched by this diff
- pnpm test:isolation: PASS (27/27 files, 186/186 tests, including the 2 new ones)

### Next

- #191–#202 (second consulting-review batch, filed 2026-07-24) otherwise remain open and
  unassigned — worth a triage session before they rot the way #191 itself sat for 6 days.
- #218 (create_entity recursion-depth gap) needs a human-approved plan-lock before pickup, since
  it changes an entity-engine package contract.

### Open questions

- None blocking.

## 2026-07-31 — #220 fixed: `loadEntityType` explicit tenant filter

**Session type:** Small security-hardening fix, branch `fix/PLAT-220-load-entity-type-tenant-filter`
**Issue closed (pending merge):** #220 — `loadEntityType` had no explicit tenant filter, relying on RLS alone (defense-in-depth gap flagged during #191 review, not exploitable today)

**What landed:**

- `loadEntityType` (`packages/entity-engine/src/engine.ts`) gained a `tenantId` param + the same `or(isNull(tenantId), eq(tenantId, …))` filter `loadEntityFields` already used
- All 9 call sites updated to pass the `tenantId` already in scope at each — no new parameter threading, no public API change (helper is unexported)
- New isolation test (`load-entity-type-tenant-filter.isolation.test.ts`) proves the explicit filter blocks cross-tenant access using a bare `db` connection (no `withTenantContext`), isolating this layer from RLS
- Full spec + task-plan pair in `docs/specs/entity-engine-load-entity-type-tenant-filter-220{,-tasks}.md`

**Verification:** typecheck 40/40, lint 40/40 (0 warnings), entity-engine unit tests 189/189, isolation tests 210/210 (31 files). Full `pnpm test` has pre-existing unrelated failures (Redis unreachable in host-mode runs per this repo's `docker-compose.yml`; already-tracked #149 flake) — logged in the spec's §B, not caused by this change.

---

## 2026-07-29 — PRs #211, #212, #214 merged; Phase 2 hardening complete

**Session type:** PR review + merge (three PRs)
**PRs merged:** #211 (feat/PLAT-notification-hub-core — Tushar Sharma), #212 (feat/PLAT-notification-hub-followups — Tushar Sharma), #214 (fix/PLAT-remove-portal-from-docker-matrix — PrabhuVijit)
**Issues closed:** #125 (`notify` action stub wired end-to-end)

**What landed in #211 (notification hub core):**

- New tables: `notifications`, `notification_recipients` — RLS-enabled, `app_user`-granted, tenant-scoped, idempotent via unique `(notification_id, user_id)` index
- New API routes: `GET /notifications` (keyset-paginated inbox), `POST /notifications/:id/read`, `POST /notifications/mark-all-read` — all scoped to caller's own auth-derived `tenantId`/`userId`
- WebSocket endpoint `/ws/notifications` — JWT via `?token=` query param, Redis pub/sub fan-out across worker processes
- 6 system-triggered notification types wired end-to-end: `entity.assigned`, `comment.mentioned`, `access.granted`, `access.revoked`, `workflow.sla_breached`, `system.error` — plus `automation.notify` tenant-authored path
- Pluggable outbound seam (`notification-outbound-worker.ts`) — `NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL` env; no-ops cleanly if not configured
- `zitadel-management.ts` relocated from `apps/api/src/lib` to `packages/auth/src` so `apps/worker` can reach `getUserById`
- `apps/portal` removed (stale; `apps/admin-ui` serves both agent and customer users)
- 10-case isolation test suite for new tables; path-traversal regression test for `markNotificationRead`

**Review rounds for #211:** 3 rounds (two CHANGES_REQUESTED, one APPROVE). Main findings:

- Round 1 (pre-CodeQL): `URL`-constructor origin guard added to `api.ts` (`doFetch`, `fetchRawWithAuth`)
- Round 2: Two tenant-isolation blockers — missing `eq(notifications.tenantId, tenantId)` in outbound worker "sent"/"failed" UPDATEs; `workflow.sla_breached` using bare `db` without `withTenantContext`; both fixed. Tests added for outbound worker. `encodeURIComponent(id)` path-traversal fix in `markNotificationRead`.
- Round 3: All blockers resolved — approved

**What landed in #212 (notification hub followups):**

- **Global outbound-notifications kill switch** — single-row `platform_settings` table (migration `0044`), `GET`/`PATCH /admin/platform-settings` admin-role-gated; both outbound-enqueue call sites gated (`notify.ts`, `notification-worker.ts`); fails closed on DB error
- **Zitadel M2M auth for outbound handoff** — `notification-outbound-auth.ts` acquires a service-account token before POSTing to `NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL`; token cached until 60 s before expiry
- **Auto-logout on inactivity** — `useIdleLogout` hook (5 min default, resets on user activity); wired in `App.tsx`
- **Settings page tabs redesign** — outbound kill switch toggle lives under new Settings → Notifications tab
- **Role-gate isolation tests** for `/admin/platform-settings`
- Migration renumber fix: `0043` → `0044` (conflict with notification tables migration from #211)

**What landed in #214 (CI fix):**

- Removed stale `portal` from Docker build matrix — `apps/portal` no longer exists; its presence caused the entire matrix job group to fail on every push to `main`
- Added `fail-fast: false` to prevent one matrix leg failure from cancelling the others

**Hardening status:**

| Backlog               | Status                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-Phase 3 hardening | ✅ **Complete** — all items closed (#121–#129, #141, #136, #125) |

## 2026-07-27 — local-disk file storage (replace S3/MinIO)

**Session type:** New feature (not on the tracked #120–#129 backlog)
**Branch:** `media` (off `tushar`)

### Completed this session

- Spec + task plan: `docs/specs/local-disk-file-storage.md`,
  `docs/specs/local-disk-file-storage-tasks.md`. Replaces `@platform/files`'
  S3/MinIO backend — presigned URLs broke on the real server
  (`S3_PUBLIC_URL=localhost:9000` only resolves in local dev).
- **`packages/files`**: `saveUpload`/`getFileStream`/`deleteFile`/
  `deleteTenantFiles` replace `initiateUpload`/`confirmUpload`/
  `getDownloadUrl` — direct `fs` calls (temp-file-then-rename for atomic
  writes) instead of S3 SDK calls. Same quota/RLS/metadata model, unchanged.
- **API routes**: `POST /files` collapsed from a two-step
  initiate+presigned-PUT+complete flow into one multipart upload; `GET
/files/:id` now streams bytes directly (with the same tenant+entity-ACL
  gate) instead of redirecting to a presigned URL.
- **`apps/worker/src/av-scan.ts`**: streams the file from disk into ClamAV's
  INSTREAM protocol instead of downloading from S3 into a buffer first.
  `file-cleanup.ts`/`tenant-purge.ts` also switched from S3 deletes to
  `fs.unlink`/recursive `fs.rm`.
- **admin-ui**: upload hook (`use-file-upload.ts`) switched to one-shot
  multipart POST; download/preview code (`file-attachment.tsx`) switched
  from following a presigned URL to fetching bytes as a Blob (binary
  downloads now require the `Authorization` header, which plain
  `<img>`/`<embed>` src attributes can't send). A duplicated upload path in
  `record-detail.tsx`'s customer attachment uploader got the same fix, plus
  a poll-for-`clean`-before-attach fix — `POST /entities/:id/attachments`
  (which writes the `file_attached` history event) requires `scanStatus ===
"clean"`, but the frontend was calling it immediately after upload, before
  the async AV scan finished, so the history event silently 422'd and never
  got written even though the file itself already showed up in the
  attachment list.
- **Infra**: `docker-compose.yml`'s `minio`/`minio-init` commented out;
  `FILES_STORAGE_PATH_HOST` (new, defaults to `../openwind-files`, sibling
  to the repo checkout — same value works on a laptop or a server)
  bind-mounted into `ow-backend`/`ow-worker` at `/data/files`.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (packages/files, packages/config, apps/api,
  apps/worker, apps/admin-ui)
- pnpm test: PASS — packages/files (17), apps/worker (70), apps/api files
  unit tests (16) + integration tests (11, run against a real Redis/Postgres
  once the pre-existing `.env.local` `SKIP_AV_SCAN=true`/no-host-Redis-port
  local-dev quirks were worked around), apps/admin-ui (53)
- pnpm test:isolation: not re-run this session (no RLS/schema changes —
  `files` table untouched)
- Manual end-to-end: built and ran the full `docker compose up -d` stack;
  verified write→read-back→stream-download→delete→404-after-delete against
  the real running containers (real Postgres, real bind-mounted disk, real
  RLS), confirmed the bind-mount is visible on the host filesystem, and
  confirmed persistence across `docker compose down`/`up`. Also manually
  exercised upload/delete/history-timeline in the browser on the ticket
  detail page.
- One real bug caught and fixed mid-session: `saveUpload`'s `SKIP_AV_SCAN`
  dev-shortcut branch updated the `files` row without setting the RLS
  tenant-context GUC first (a regression from the old `confirmUpload`, which
  had that context already open in its own transaction) — fixed by wrapping
  it in a `db.transaction` with `set_config('app.tenant_id', ...)`.

### Next

- Not yet pushed/PR'd as of this entry — pending `git push` to `media`.
- `.env.server`/production deployment still needs `FILES_STORAGE_PATH_HOST`
  set (or left to its sibling-directory default) on the real server before
  the next deploy.

### Open questions

- None blocking.

## 2026-07-27 (later) — production deploy + a real pre-existing bug it exposed

**Session type:** Deploy of the above `media` branch to the `tushar` branch
and the production server, plus a follow-up fix

### Completed this session

- Merged `media` into `tushar` (fast-forward), pushed, deleted `media`.
- Deployed to the production server: `git pull`, rebuilt `ow-backend`,
  `ow-frontend`, **and `ow-worker`** (the existing `server-up.sh` script only
  rebuilds backend+frontend — had to run the `docker compose ... up -d
--build` command manually with `ow-worker` included, since our AV-scan/
  file-cleanup/tenant-purge changes live there). `--remove-orphans` cleanly
  removed the now-unmanaged MinIO containers; confirmed the bucket was empty
  first (`mc ls` — no migration needed).
- **Found and fixed a real pre-existing production bug**, exposed for the
  first time by this deploy: `apps/worker/src/av-scan.ts`'s DB queries (the
  idempotency-check select, both `clean`/`quarantined` status updates, and
  the failure-handler's update+outbox-insert) were bare `db.select()`/
  `update()`/`insert()` calls, never wrapped in `withTenantContext`. Against
  a real PgBouncer-pooled connection this throws `invalid input syntax for
type uuid: ""` — the RLS policy's `app.tenant_id` GUC was unset/stale, and
  casting the empty default to `uuid` fails outright (unlike a fresh direct
  psql connection, where an unset custom GUC just returns `NULL` and the
  query silently returns zero rows — which is why a manual `psql` repro
  didn't reproduce it and a from-inside-the-app repro script was needed to
  see the real `.cause`). This code was untouched by the S3→disk migration
  itself (same shape before and after) — it never surfaced before because
  uploads never reached the AV-scan queue under the old broken
  presigned-URL flow. Fixed by wrapping every DB call in `av-scan.ts` with
  `withTenantContext`, matching the convention everywhere else in the
  codebase (`tenant-purge.ts` already did this correctly).
- Logged as B1/B2 and promoted to a `§V` invariant in
  `docs/specs/local-disk-file-storage.md`: any bare `db` call in tenant-scoped
  worker code is a production bug, not just a lint nit — it breaks under
  PgBouncer transaction pooling even though it may look fine against a
  fresh, unpooled connection.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (apps/worker)
- pnpm test: PASS — apps/worker (70, including updated `av-scan.test.ts`
  mocking `withTenantContext`)
- Manual: reproduced the exact failing query through the app's own DB client
  inside the running `ow-worker` container on the server, confirmed the real
  `PostgresError` cause, applied the fix, rebuilt `ow-worker` again

### Next

- Re-test the full upload → scan → clean → timeline flow on the live server
  now that the worker fix is deployed.
- Consider fixing `av-scan.ts`'s (and other worker code's) error logging to
  include `err.cause`, not just `String(err)` — this bug's root cause was
  invisible in the app's own logs and required a manual repro script to see.

### Open questions

- None blocking.

## 2026-07-27 (later still) — ClamAV was never actually deployed anywhere

**Session type:** Infra gap fix, found while re-testing the worker fix above

### Completed this session

- After the `withTenantContext` fix (previous entry) deployed cleanly, the
  next upload attempt still failed — `av-scan: job failed` with
  `AggregateError` (a connection failure) on every retry. Root cause:
  **`docker-compose.yml` never had a ClamAV service at all** —
  `CLAMAV_HOST` defaults to `localhost`, which inside the worker container
  resolves to nothing. `SKIP_AV_SCAN=true` was briefly considered as a
  quick unblock, but `packages/config/src/env.ts` has a deliberate
  production guard (`.refine(...)`) that refuses to boot if
  `SKIP_AV_SCAN=true` and `NODE_ENV=production` — written specifically to
  stop antivirus scanning from being silently disabled in production.
  Since the server's containers do run with `NODE_ENV=production`, that
  path was a dead end anyway, and disabling AV scanning for uploaded ticket
  attachments isn't something to route around lightly.
- Added a real `clamav` service (`clamav/clamav:stable`) to
  `docker-compose.yml`, wired `ow-worker` to depend on it
  (`condition: service_healthy`) and point `CLAMAV_HOST`/`CLAMAV_PORT` at
  it. Confirmed server has 62GB RAM / 51GB available / 16 cores — plenty of
  headroom for ClamAV's ~1GB footprint. `start_period: 300s` on its
  healthcheck since first boot downloads the virus signature DB
  (freshclam), which can take a few minutes.
- This closes a gap that predates the S3→disk migration entirely — AV
  scanning was designed into the system (`av-scan.ts`, the `scanStatus`
  state machine, the download gate) but never actually had a scanner to
  talk to in this deployment, on either the server or (via `SKIP_AV_SCAN`)
  local dev.

### Verification

- `docker compose config --quiet`: PASS (compose file is syntactically
  valid with the new service)
- Pending: deploy to server, confirm ClamAV container reaches healthy,
  confirm a fresh upload reaches `scanStatus: "clean"` end-to-end

### Next

- Deploy: `git pull` + rebuild `ow-worker` (no other service needs
  rebuilding) on the server, wait for `ow-clamav` to report healthy
  (can take a few minutes on first boot), re-test upload.

### Open questions

- None blocking.

## 2026-07-25 — global outbound-notifications kill switch (dev session)

**Session type:** New feature (not on the tracked #120–#129 backlog)
**Branch:** `tushar` (merged `notification` + `workflow` branches in first)

### Completed this session

- Merged `notification` (fast-forward) and `workflow` (clean 3-way merge, no
  conflicts) branches into `tushar`; pushed to origin.
- **Global outbound-notifications kill switch**
  (`docs/specs/outbound-notifications-kill-switch.md`): a single
  platform-wide toggle, admin-only, on the Settings page, to stop the
  outbound email/SMS/WhatsApp handoff without touching in-app delivery.
  Deliberately **not per-tenant** — the failure mode (external delivery
  service down/misbehaving) affects every tenant identically.
  - New single-row `platform_settings` table (migration `0044`), no
    tenant_id/RLS — a platform-operator concern, same pattern as
    `modules.isVisible`.
  - `isOutboundNotificationsEnabled()` fails **closed** (disabled) on any DB
    error or missing row — the switch exists specifically to stop outbound
    traffic during an incident, so erring toward "don't send" is safer.
  - `GET`/`PATCH /admin/platform-settings`, admin-role-gated.
  - Both outbound-enqueue call sites gated:
    `packages/automation-engine/src/actions/notify.ts` and
    `apps/worker/src/notification-worker.ts`.
  - Settings-page toggle, same optimistic-update-with-revert pattern as the
    existing module-visibility toggle.

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS (packages/db, automation-engine, worker, api, admin-ui)
- pnpm test: PASS for all touched suites (notify.test.ts,
  notification-worker.test.ts, notifications isolation tests). Full
  `apps/api` suite has 4 pre-existing failures unrelated to this feature
  (file quarantine/AV-scan and module-seed tests) — not introduced by this
  change, not touched by its scope.
- pnpm lint: N/A — repo-wide no-op per #141.
- Migrations applied to both the `platform` dev DB and the `platform_test`
  DB used by `apps/api`'s test suite.

### Open questions

- None blocking. The 4 pre-existing `apps/api` test failures (quarantine/
  upload/modules seed) are worth a follow-up session — not caused by this
  work but discovered while re-verifying the full suite.

## 2026-07-24 — Docs/config hygiene bundle: #193, #203, #204 closed

**Session type:** Docs + config (mechanical fixes, no code)
**Branch:** `chore/PLAT-193-docs-config-hygiene`
**Spec:** `docs/specs/docs-config-hygiene-193-203-204.md`

### Completed this session

- **#203** — `architecture-brief.md`'s module map was stale: it referenced a `@platform/search`
  package that doesn't exist under `packages/`, and listed `inventory` (never built) instead of
  `tender` (the platform's actual, shipped 8th module). Removed the dead package reference,
  swapped `inventory` → `tender`, and added a `Category` column citing ADR-005 (`core` for the
  original 7, `optional` for `tender`).
- **#204** — `docs/local-setup.md` didn't mention OpenBao or MinIO at all despite both being real,
  uncommented `docker-compose.yml` services. Added a full section: env vars, first-run init
  steps, and the PR #178 idempotent-retry gotcha (`openbao-init`'s "transit engine already
  enabled" message on repeat `docker compose up` is expected, not a failure). Root `SETUP.md`
  duplicated and was staler than `docs/local-setup.md`; since `README.md` links the root path
  directly, turned it into a one-line pointer rather than deleting it outright.
- **#193** — all 10 non-core `docker-compose.yml` images were pinned to floating `:latest`.
  Pulled each fresh and pinned to its actual resolved digest (a freeze, not an upgrade) —
  `openbao`/`openbao-init` share one digest as required. Found along the way that the three
  `novu-*` images have already drifted apart upstream (api/worker rebuilt 2026-07-08, web not
  since 2025-03-21) — pinned each to its real current state and documented the drift in
  `local-setup.md` rather than forcing an artificial match. Added a bump policy note (deliberate,
  own commit, never silent).
- Went through this repo's full Plan → Code → Review flow for all three: spec written and
  stress-tested (`/spec-review` found two blockers — T4's wording risked upgrading instead of
  freezing versions, and the two `openbao` lines had no parity requirement — both fixed before
  implementation), plan-lock drafted and human-approved, implementation verified against every
  acceptance criterion (grep checks, `docker compose config`, `docker compose pull`, README link
  check), `pnpm typecheck`/`lint` confirmed green. `pnpm test` has one pre-existing failure
  (`@platform/auth`, missing `platform_test` DB) confirmed via `git stash` to exist identically
  on the base commit — not a regression from this change.
- `docs/sup-docs/roadmap-tracker.md` deliberately **not** touched this session: it's already
  substantially owned by in-flight PR #189, which predates and doesn't cover these three issues —
  editing it here would risk an avoidable merge conflict for no scorecard benefit (none of
  #193/#203/#204 are phase-tracked items).

### Verification

- pnpm typecheck: PASS
- pnpm lint: PASS
- pnpm test: 1 pre-existing, unrelated failure (`@platform/auth` — missing `platform_test` DB),
  confirmed pre-existing via `git stash` comparison against the base commit
- pnpm test:isolation: N/A — blocked by the same missing DB, and not triggered anyway (no new
  tables/routes in this diff)

### Next

- Open the PR for `chore/PLAT-193-docs-config-hygiene`, closing #193/#203/#204.
- Once PR #189 merges, its roadmap-tracker.md rewrite will still need a follow-up mention of
  these three closures if the scorecard is meant to reflect every closed issue.

## 2026-07-24 — Hardening backlog closeout: #167/#160/#170/#129/#176 closed, RLS/ADR-007 + nit-bug batches in review, docs audit

**Session type:** Mixed (parallel backlog work + guardrail infra fix + full docs audit)
**Branches:** `fix/PLAT-167-grant-access-consistency`, `fix/PLAT-160-state-validation`,
`fix/PLAT-176-hook-worktree-per-branch-state`, `chore/PLAT-128-openbao-init-idempotent`,
`chore/PLAT-batch2-nit-fixes`, `docs/PLAT-*` (this cleanup)

### Completed this session

- **#167** (`grant-access.ts` should accept workflow-admin callers) — closed via PR #179. Ported
  the `isPrivileged || isRecordWorkflowAdmin` pattern already used by the three sibling ACL
  routes; deliberately no `isOwner` path (direct-grant stays admin/workflow-admin-only per
  `resolve-access-request.ts`'s own rationale). Adversarial review found no issues in the core
  logic; strengthened unit-test call-argument assertions per its one suggestion.
- **#160** (`setEntityState`/`bulkSetState` don't validate target state) — closed via PR #180.
  Mirrors `updateEntity`'s existing `workflow_states` check, including the child-ticket
  fixed-state-list branch. Adversarial review caught two real bugs before ship: a duplicate-id
  index-collapse bug in `bulkSetState`'s error reporting, and a missing child-ticket check
  (children inherit their parent's `workflowId`, so without this they'd validate against the
  parent's full workflow instead of the fixed open/in-progress/closed set) — both fixed.
- **#176** (guardrail hooks: shared state clobbers across branches, `edit-gate` silently bypasses
  worktrees) — closed via PR #177. New `.claude/hooks/lib/context.js`; state now keyed per-branch
  (`.claude/state/<kind>/<branch-slug>.json`); `edit-gate`/`commit-gate`/`ship-cleanup` resolve
  the actual worktree a tool call targets instead of the hook's own inherited cwd;
  `approval-gate`/`verify-stop` (no anchor available from a chat prompt or Stop event) scan all
  linked worktrees and report ambiguity rather than guessing. Caught and fixed a real bug during
  verification: a raw-vs-trimmed hash mismatch between `write-ship-marker.sh` and
  `commit-gate.sh`/`approval-gate.sh` that would have made every real `approve-ship` fail.
- **#128 follow-up** (openbao-init idempotency, flagged in PR #173's review) — closed via a
  standalone PR, verified live against two consecutive `docker compose up` runs.
- **#170** (`installModule` rename dead for non-templated seeds), **#129** (worker health
  endpoint) — both already closed 2026-07-24 via PRs #174/#175 (see below, same day, prior
  session block); reconciled into this backlog view.
- **ADR-005** (core/optional module category, tender ratification) and **ADR-006** (per-workflow
  ownership/admin model) — both accepted 2026-07-23/24, resolving the two open questions the
  2026-07-22 reconciliation explicitly left for a human: `tender` is now the platform's 8th
  module (optional category, `modules.category` column itself not yet built — tracked as #165),
  and the per-workflow ownership model is permanent, accepted policy.
- **ADR-007** (RLS for `entity_types`/`workflows`/`workflow_states`/`workflow_transitions`) —
  accepted; implementation in PR #181 (open, not yet merged — CI green, awaiting a fresh review
  since the one approval it got was auto-dismissed by a post-approval merge + 1-line fixture fix).
- **Nit-bug batches** — PR #186 (#182–185, from reviews of PRs #175/#177/#179/#180) and PR #188
  (#187, #171, #150, #148, #110) bundled and shipped, matching this repo's established pattern of
  batching small independent fixes into one PR. #171 turned out non-trivial: deleting helpdesk's
  vestigial `001_seed.sql` required also templating `002_workflow.sql`'s workflow name via
  `{WORKFLOW_NAME}` (matching #170's convention) so the install-rename fast path kept working,
  which cascaded into fixing a test that hardcoded the literal `"ticket_workflow"` string. Both
  PRs open, CI green, awaiting review.
- **Full docs audit** — read and cross-checked every file in `docs/` (excluding `decisions/` and
  `specs/`) against actual current repo state via 4 parallel review passes. Acted on this session:
  deleted `analysis-2026-05-22.md` and `first-loop-task.md` (fully superseded, confirmed via
  `gh issue view` that every carry-over issue they discuss is closed); tightened
  `phase-timeline.md` (kept the still-true velocity baseline and operating model, cut the
  now-wrong dated projections, restored the Phase 1 carry-over decision table into this doc
  rather than losing it); reconciled this doc (`roadmap-tracker.md`) against the backlog above;
  consolidated all 4 `docs/reviews/*` files into
  [`docs/reviews/pending-review-findings.md`](../reviews/pending-review-findings.md) — only
  still-open findings kept, deduplicated across sources, each noting whether it already has a
  tracked issue (most of the CTO/consulting-review security findings do; most of the
  ux-adoption-review's product findings never got filed at all, which the audit flags as the
  likely reason they saw zero progress since 2026-06-23). **Not acted on this session** (see
  "Next"): `architecture-brief.md`'s phantom `@platform/search` package and never-built
  `inventory` module (omits `tender`); `local-setup.md` missing OpenBao/MinIO entirely (added to
  `docker-compose.yml` after the doc was last touched) and a duplicate, more-stale root
  `SETUP.md`.
- **Assignment clarity:** #161/#162/#163/#165 confirmed informally assigned to Tushar Sharma;
  #143/#125 confirmed informally assigned to Bikash Barnwal (via chat, not GitHub's `assignees`
  field, which this repo has never used). Local-only `open-issues-tracker.md` created (gitignored
  by request) to track this without committing individual names into shared docs.
- **#117** (week-log/roadmap-tracker never updated for #93–#100) — investigated and closed.
  `gh pr view 115` showed `closingIssuesReferences: []`: PR #115's title named all five issues
  but its body never used `Closes #N` syntax, so only #93/#94/#98 auto-closed; #99 and #100
  had sat open for over a month despite the code being genuinely shipped (verified directly —
  `addState`/`updateState`/`deleteState`/`deleteTransition` in `workflow-canvas.tsx`, the
  `PUT /workflows/:id/canvas` endpoint and its `canvas.test.ts`/`canvas.isolation.test.ts`
  coverage). Closed both with an explanatory comment citing the code and this log. This entry
  (above, retitled) and the `roadmap-tracker.md` 2D row now cite all five issue numbers
  explicitly, satisfying #117's literal acceptance criteria — #117 itself closed as a result.

### Next

- Merge #181, #186, #188 (all CI green, awaiting review)
- #143 and #125 — assigned to Bikash Barnwal, not this session's queue
- #161/#162/#163/#165 — assigned to Tushar Sharma, not this session's queue
- Finish the docs audit follow-through: `architecture-brief.md` module-map fix (drop
  `@platform/search`/`inventory`, add `tender`), `local-setup.md` OpenBao/MinIO gap + `SETUP.md`
  duplication
- #165 — implement ADR-005's `modules.category` column + auto-provisioning (Tushar)

### Open questions

- None blocking — both prior open questions (tender scope, ownership-model ADR) resolved this
  session via ADR-005/ADR-006.

---

## 2026-07-23 — Tail of prior hardening sprint: #141, #168, #128, ADR-005 accepted

**Session type:** Backlog (pre-existing work, reconciled into this log after the fact — see
`open-issues-tracker.md`'s note on informal `@username` assignments for why this wasn't logged
in real time)

### Completed

- **#141** (`pnpm lint` repo-wide no-op) — closed via PR #166.
- **#168** (shadow-workflow entity-type-ownership escalation, found during ADR-006 review) —
  closed via PR #172: `UNIQUE(tenant_id, entity_type_id)` migration on `workflows`, atomic
  `onConflictDoNothing()` handling, admin/agent-only role restriction on workflow creation.
- **#128** (OpenBao + MinIO commented out of `docker-compose.yml`) — closed via PR #173.
- **ADR-005** (core vs. optional module classification, tender ratification) — accepted.

### Next

- See 2026-07-24 entry above — this tail fed directly into that session's larger closeout.

## 2026-07-24 — ADR-007 accepted and implemented: RLS for workflow config tables (#136)

**Session type:** Feature (ADR-driven hardening)
**Branch:** `feat/PLAT-136-rls-workflow-config-tables`

### Completed this session

- Drafted, adversarially reviewed (three rounds), and got human sign-off on ADR-007, then
  implemented it: migration 0037 adds RLS to `entity_types`/`workflows` (nullable-tenant,
  `entity_fields`-shape) and `workflow_states`/`workflow_transitions` (new `tenant_id NOT NULL`
  column, backfilled, `entity_instances`-shape) — closing the last four tables in the platform
  without a database-level tenant isolation backstop.
- Updated every module's seed SQL (9 files) to supply `tenant_id` for the newly-`NOT NULL`
  columns — without this, every module install would have started failing the moment the
  migration shipped.
- Found and fixed an unrelated pre-existing bug while writing the regression test for
  `tenant-purge.ts`: `admin_audit_log`'s CHECK constraint never allowed the
  `purge.completed`/`purge.failed` actions the purge worker writes, so every real tenant purge
  has been silently failing that audit-trail write in production (migration 0038).
- A second adversarial review (code-level, post-implementation) caught that the `NOT
VALID`/`VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` low-lock migration technique doesn't work in this repo — the
  drizzle-orm postgres-js migrator batches every pending migration into one transaction, so the
  `ADD COLUMN` lock is already held for the whole batch regardless. Simplified both migrations
  back to a direct `SET NOT NULL`. Also added explicit `tenant_id` filters (defense-in-depth,
  alongside RLS) to several `workflow-crud.ts`/`engine.ts`/`canvas.ts`/`tenant-purge.ts` query
  sites that had relied on RLS alone.
- `/security-review` run: no high-confidence findings.
- `docs/decisions/ADR-007-rls-workflow-config-tables.md` still asserts the disproven low-lock
  claim in its Implementation specification — needs a human correction (agents don't edit
  accepted ADRs).

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint`: PASS (41/41 packages)
- `pnpm test`: PASS (473 tests, up from 472 pre-existing — new symmetric write-block test)
- `pnpm test:isolation`: PASS (170 tests, up from 169) — new `apps/worker/tests/isolation/`
  capability added (didn't exist before this session)

### Next

- #125, #128, #129 remain open in the pre-Phase-3 hardening backlog (unrelated to this session)
- Human correction needed on ADR-007's Implementation specification (low-lock claim)
- Production row counts for `workflow_states`/`workflow_transitions` still unconfirmed before
  this migration runs against a real environment (ADR-007 Open Question OQ-1)

---

## 2026-07-22 — Doc reconciliation: PRs #144/#151/#152/#155 surfaced, #127 closed out

**Session type:** Docs (comprehensive project review)
**Branch:** `docs/PLAT-127-tracker-reconciliation`

### Completed this session

- Pulled 23 new commits on `main` (up to PR #155) and ran a full review: vision-alignment
  check against `architecture-brief.md`/ADRs, a security/architecture pass on the new surface,
  and a local health check (typecheck/lint/test).
- Found `CLAUDE.md`, `roadmap-tracker.md`, and `week-log.md` had not been updated for PR #144
  (2026-07-16: child tickets, a new `modules/tender` vertical, access requests, security
  hardening) or PRs #151/#152/#155 (2026-07-21: tenant-org-id mapping, request-access UI,
  per-workflow ownership model + closing #127). This work was authored outside the
  `openwind-loop` process — no plan-lock, no PROGRESS.md entries for the feature work itself
  (only a later security-audit pass on top of it got logged) — which is why these three files
  went silent on it.
- Verified directly in code (not just the PR title) that **#127 is genuinely closed**:
  `setEntityState`/`bulkSetState` (`packages/entity-engine/src/engine.ts`) now both insert a
  `workflow_events` row and a `workflow.transitioned` outbox event when the state changes.
  Marked closed in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Security/architecture review of the new surface (access-request/grant/revoke flow,
  child-ticket routes, tenant-org-id mapping, `modules/tender`) found no IDOR or escalation
  path: RLS + explicit tenant filters present, 404-not-403 followed, org-id mapping fails
  closed, the new `read_only` ACL only widens read paths, and `modules/tender` genuinely
  respects the zero-TypeScript rule.
- New finding, not yet filed: `setEntityState`/`bulkSetState` don't validate the target state
  against `workflow_states` (unlike `updateEntity`) — noted in `CLAUDE.md` and the tracker, not
  fixed this session.
- Flagged two decisions for human/ADR sign-off rather than deciding them in the docs: (1) is
  `tender` a sanctioned 8th module, and (2) an ADR for the new per-workflow ownership/admin
  authorization model introduced by PR #155.
- Re-confirmed **#141** (`pnpm lint` no-op) is still live: `turbo run lint` only executes
  `build` tasks; zero packages have a real `lint` script.
- Re-checked **#149**: its title claims "9 pre-existing failures," but the issue body lists 4
  and `view-configs.test.ts` itself has exactly 4 `it()` blocks — the count looks stale/wrong;
  flagged, not corrected in the issue itself this session.
- Added the new shipped-but-unclassified work as its own section in `roadmap-tracker.md`
  (cross-referencing the specs behind it) rather than slotting it into an existing phase.

### Next

- Human decision: tender module scope (ADR or explicit rejection) + ADR for the per-workflow
  ownership/access-grant authorization model
- File + fix: `setEntityState`/`bulkSetState` missing state-value validation
- Reconcile `#149`'s stated failure count against its own body/the test file
- Remaining open hardening items: #125, #128, #129, #136, #141, #143
- Small open housekeeping: #148 (corepack integrity hash), #150 (`PROGRESS.md`
  gitignore-claim contradiction), #116/#117 (export-pattern ADR + week-log backfill)

### Open questions

- Should `tender` be folded into the standard module list (`architecture-brief.md`'s 8-module
  map currently lists _inventory_, not _tender_), or treated as one-off/reconsidered? Owner
  decision required — not made in this session.

## 2026-07-21 — PR #155 merged; #127 closed + IDOR gaps + per-workflow ownership

**Session type:** PR review + doc cleanup
**PRs merged this session:** #151, #152, #153, #154, #155

### Completed this session

- PR #151 (`fix(auth,api): map Zitadel org ids to tenants; accept read_only ACL level`) — reviewed
  and approved (@TusharSharma991). Org→tenant UUID lookup production fix, `zitadel_org_id` column,
  `read_only` ACL level treated as sufficient for entity reads.
- PR #152 (`feat(admin-ui,portal): request-access UI on record detail`) — CHANGES_REQUESTED
  (IMP-1: portal noAccess check fired on any 404, not just the record fetch); fix validated and
  approved.
- PRs #153, #154 — merged (confirmed by user; no review sessions this session).
- PR #155 (`feat(workflow-engine,api,admin-ui): per-workflow ownership/admin model + #127/IDOR fixes`)
  — thorough review posted as CHANGES_REQUESTED with 2 blockers:
  - BLOCKER-1: four IDOR-fix routes used `hasEntityReadAccess` instead of `hasEntityAccess`,
    locking workflow admins out of record events/relations/transitions.
  - BLOCKER-2: migration `0033_workflow_created_by` out of order in `_journal.json` (appended
    after already-applied 0034); renumbered to 0035.
    Fix commit `0793254` addressed both blockers + tightened `grant-access.ts` test (G-3). Approved
    and merged to main (2026-07-21T15:01Z).

## 2026-07-24 — workflow builder UX pass + template visibility governance + Docs guardrail stage

**Session type:** UI/UX polish + one new feature (not on the tracked #120–#129 backlog)
**Branch:** `workflow`

### Completed this session

- **Cascading rename restored, with a real fix over the earlier version**: renaming a Step's
  internal name in the workflow builder cascades into `workflow_transitions.fromState`/`toState`,
  `workflows.initialState`, **and now `entity_instances.currentState`** — the earlier version of
  this feature missed the last one, which would have silently stranded in-flight tickets on a
  stale state name. New engine-level test coverage added (`workflow-crud.test.ts` — did not exist
  before).
- **Workflow builder terminology**: Steps/Actions/Details to Collect plain-language pass applied
  to `apps/admin-ui/src/pages/workflows/index.tsx` (the workflow list) — the detail page had
  already been rewritten in an earlier session; the list page was missed and still said "state
  machine definitions."
- **Fixed a real naming bug**: `sales-pipeline`/`nsi-amendment`/`tender`/`helpdesk` seed SQL
  hardcoded `workflows.name` to a raw snake_case slug (used as an internal lookup key across
  seed statements), so the UI displayed e.g. `sales_pipeline_workflow` verbatim instead of a
  human-readable name. Fixed by switching to the existing `{WORKFLOW_NAME}` substitution token
  and re-keying internal lookups on `entity_type_id` instead of `name`.
- **Fixed app-wide validation error messages**: `@hono/zod-validator`'s default (no-hook)
  behavior returns the raw `ZodError` object as `body.error`; the frontend's
  `new Error(body.error)` stringified that to the literal text `"[object Object]"` for every
  validation failure across the entire app, not just one route. Added
  `apps/api/src/lib/validator.ts`, a typed wrapper that formats a readable message + fields
  array, rewired across all 58 route files' imports.
- **Removed Email/URL from the Detail Type dropdown** — neither was ever a real backend field
  type (`packages/entity-engine/src/field-types.ts`), so selecting either always failed
  validation silently.
- **UI polish pass** across `/records`, `/records/:type/records` (kanban board), the record
  detail page, `/modules`, `/workflows`, and `/settings`: fixed washed-out grey card
  surfaces (a page-background-vs-card-background contrast bug — introduced a `--bg-card` /
  `--bg-secondary` layering convention used consistently going forward), added consistent card
  shadows, fixed-height kanban columns with internal scroll, fixed-height record cards with
  buttons pinned to the bottom, added search to `/records`, redesigned the `/workflows` list
  (stats overview strip, active/inactive grouping, per-workflow entity icons, larger rows).
- **New feature — template visibility governance** (not part of the tracked backlog, direct
  ask): `modules.is_visible` (migration `0039_module_visibility.sql`), a global platform-wide
  toggle. `GET /modules` (Templates page) is always filtered to visible-only for every role,
  including admin — `GET /modules?includeHidden=true` (admin-only, used by the new Settings
  page management card) sees hidden ones too, so admin can re-enable them. 7 new route tests.
  This platform has no separate `superadmin` tier — `admin` is the top role — the feature was
  built once for `superadmin` and corrected to `admin` mid-session.
- **Guardrail tooling**: added a **Docs** stage to the Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship
  pipeline. New `write-docs-marker.sh` hook (`--touched` or `--skip "<reason>"`), wired into
  `commit-gate.sh` (blocks `git commit` without a docs marker matching the current diff, same
  binding pattern as the existing review marker), `ship-cleanup.sh` (one-shot cleanup),
  `.claude/README.md`, `agent-behaviour.md`, `definition-of-done.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` updated
  to document it. This week-log entry + the Docs stage addition are themselves the marker's
  first real use.

### Phase snapshot

No change to Phase 3 hardening backlog status this session — this was direct UI/UX work +
one ad-hoc feature request, not #120–#129 progress. #127 is still the next hardening item.

### Next

- Pick up #127 (`setEntityState`/`bulkSetState` unguarded state side-doors) — still next in
  the hardening queue, untouched this session.
- The workflow ID-based-linking spec (`docs/specs/workflow-id-based-linking.md`) remains
  drafted but not implemented — paused earlier this session in favor of the smaller
  cascading-rename fix; revisit if step-deletion/reordering becomes a near-term priority.

## 2026-07-10 — close out #120 in docs (PR #139 merged 2026-07-09)

**Session type:** Docs (following code merge)
**Branch:** `docs/PLAT-120-checklist-update`

### Completed this session

- PR #139 (`workflow.transitioned` outbox double-trigger + depth-reset fix, #120 — the
  `entity.assigned` outbox event itself was introduced earlier by PR #138/#126; #139 only
  added depth-carrying to that existing payload) confirmed merged to `main`
  (2026-07-09T11:09:01Z), including the full PR review-fix round (positive-allowlist outbox
  routing, dead-letter `system.error` rows, depth-leak fix in condition evaluation, vitest
  alias, test cleanup fixes) and issue #143 (Phase 3A outbox/connector tracking issue, filed
  during the #139 review — not a PR, still open).
- PR #142 (docs reconciliation for #126) confirmed merged — approved by @PrabhuVijit with
  two non-blocking suggestions (expected week-log drift; a note to flag #120/#127 ordering
  in the next reconciliation, addressed below).
- `CLAUDE.md`: marked #120 done in the hardening checklist; added a note that #120 (PR #139)
  merged ahead of #127, out of the queue's originally stated priority order (#127 was still
  next based on the 2026-06-29 consulting review, but #126 and #120 were in the same review
  session and merged the same day (2026-07-09), so #120 landed before #127 was picked up)
  — #127 remains the next item to pick up.
- `docs/reviews/2026-06-29-consulting-review.md`: struck #120 from the "Close remaining
  hardening items" action-list line, renumbered the remaining items.

## 2026-07-09 — #126 merged; doc reconciliation

**Session type:** Docs (following code merge)
**Branch:** `docs/PLAT-126-checklist-update`

### Completed this session

- PR #138 (`entity.created`/`entity.assigned` outbox triggers, #126) merged to `main`,
  including the full PR review-fix round (redaction fail-open fix, seed-validation
  discriminated union, drift-detection test, bulk-path isolation tests).
- Resolved `PROGRESS.md` merge conflicts on both `fix/PLAT-126-entity-created-triggers`
  (against `main`) and `fix/PLAT-120-automation-depth-recursion` (against `main` post-#138)
  — conflicts were from concurrent log entries, not competing code changes.
- Found PR #139 (#120) was still based on the now-merged `fix/PLAT-126-entity-created-triggers`
  branch instead of `main` (a stacked-PR setup from before #138 merged), which silently
  prevented CI from triggering (`ci.yml`'s `pull_request` trigger only matches
  `branches: [main, develop]`). Retargeted to `main` and cycled the PR closed/reopened to
  force a `synchronize` CI run (changing the base fires `edited`, which isn't a default
  trigger type).
- `CLAUDE.md`: marked #126 done in the hardening checklist.
- `roadmap-tracker.md`: cleared the stale 2B gap note about `entity.created` never firing;
  updated "Last updated" line.
- `docs/reviews/2026-06-29-consulting-review.md`: added ✅ RESOLVED notes for #126 (Blocker 3,
  the reality-check table row, and the prioritized action list), matching the #121/#122

## 2026-07-08 — Consulting-review followup: doc reconciliation

**Session type:** Documentation
**Branch:** `docs/consulting-review-followup-121-122`

### Completed this session

- Updated `docs/reviews/2026-06-29-consulting-review.md` with ✅ RESOLVED notes for #121/#122
  (closed via PR #135) and the three quick-win doc fixes below
- `roadmap-tracker.md`: Phase 2 gate wording changed from "Pilot customer onboarding" to
  "Pre-Phase 3 hardening items #120–#129 all closed"
- `platform-vision.md`: added a numbering-note callout above the Phase 0–6 roadmap diagram —
  investigation found the "Phase 2 ▶ NEXT" the review flagged as contradicting CLAUDE.md
  wasn't stale data, it's a different numbering scheme (this doc's Phase 0–6 long-term
  roadmap vs. CLAUDE.md's Phase 1/2/3 execution tracking) that was undocumented and
  confusing; added the mapping instead of changing the (accurate) diagram status
- `CLAUDE.md`: added ADR-004 (config-first module design) to the reference docs list,
  surfaced second (after `architecture-brief.md`) per the review's §8 observation;
  description softened to "most directly relevant to module authoring decisions"

### Next

#126 (`entity.created`/`entity.assigned` triggers), then #127 (guard `setEntityState`/
`bulkSetState`) — both core-function/compliance gaps per the consulting review's immediate
priority list.

## 2026-07-07 — Hardening #121 / #122: RLS role enforcement (PR #135)

**Session type:** Feature / security fix
**Branch:** `fix/PLAT-121-rls-role` → PR #135 (merged)

### Completed this session

- `withTenantContext` / `executeRawInTenantContext` now issue `SET LOCAL ROLE app_user`
  before setting the tenant GUC, closing #121
- Migration `0022_app_user_rls_grants.sql` grants `app_user` the write privileges needed to
  keep existing routes working under the new role (later tightened to column-scoped grants
  on `tenants` per PR review)
- Un-skipped the three cross-tenant RLS isolation tests, closing #122; one had no real
  assertion at all and needed a genuine fixture (a vacuous-test bug caught in code review)
- Filed #136 to track a separately-scoped gap found during review: `entity_types`/
  `workflows`/`workflow_states`/`workflow_transitions` have no RLS policy at all

## 2026-06-24 — Post-review followup (PR #130)

**Session type:** Documentation / tracking
**Branch:** `docs/post-review-followup` → PR #130

### Completed this session

- Created GH issues #120–#129 for all 10 pre-Phase 3 hardening items (labelled `phase:2`)
- Backfilled issue links into CLAUDE.md hardening checklist
- Written PROGRESS.md with priority-ordered hardening sprint and session handoff
- Fixed VISION.md wording, platform-vision.md P1 chart style (S2 from review)
- Addressed PR #130 review: CLAUDE.md gate changed from "pilot" to "3A start"; checklist reordered by dependency; roadmap-tracker now lists both label queries; agent-behaviour.md PROGRESS.md template updated; PROGRESS.md cleaned up

### Phase snapshot

## 2026-06-23 — External review; doc reconciliation

**Session type:** Documentation / planning
**Branch:** `main`, clean

### Completed this session

- Received three-lens external review (CTO architecture + risk, Product capability, UX adoption) dated 2026-06-23.
- Reconciled CLAUDE.md, VISION.md, db-conventions.md with code reality (Phase 2 was 100% complete but docs still showed 0%/95%).
- Identified pre-Phase 3 hardening items (10 issues, no code changed yet — see CLAUDE.md Current Focus).

### Key findings (external review)

- **Engineering health: 6.5/10.** Well-architected core; dragged down by untested RLS guarantee, unbounded automation recursion, and dev-grade ops.
- **Product capability: ~80% of platform engine built.** Gaps: notification delivery is a stub, `entity.created`/`entity.assigned` triggers never fire, `setEntityState` is an unguarded side-door, 6 of 7 module seeds have no automations.
- **UX adoption: 7/10.** Strong admin experience; portal field inputs for `file`/`user_ref`/`entity_ref`/`formula`/`lookup` fall back to plain text inputs. No a11y floor on modals, no i18n, no demo seed data.
- **Docs were stale:** CLAUDE.md showed 2B as "0% done", VISION.md showed 2A as "95%". Both corrected.
- **Dangerous doc:** `db-conventions.md` said "no query needs WHERE tenant_id" — corrected to require both explicit filters AND RLS.

### Phase snapshot

| Track   | Status           |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Phase 2 | ✅ 100% complete |
| Phase 3 | 🔴 Not started   |

### Next

- Human planning sign-off required before Phase 3 (3A) starts.
- Pre-Phase 3 hardening sprint recommended (10 items in CLAUDE.md) before pilot goes live.

## 2026-06-18 — Track 2D export API + workflow canvas — PR #115 merged (issues #93, #94, #98, #99, #100)

**Session type:** Feature implementation + review cycle (4 rounds)
**Branch:** `feat/93-98-export-api-workflow-canvas` → PR #115 merged

Covers all 5 issues from this track: #93 (export API), #94 (export UI), #98 (workflow
canvas), #99 (canvas edit ops — add/rename/delete state, delete transition), #100 (atomic
canvas save endpoint + dirty-state/`beforeunload` guard). PR #115's title named all five but
its body never used `Closes #N` syntax, so GitHub only auto-closed #93/#94/#98 — #99/#100
sat open until caught and closed on 2026-07-24 (see that entry below) despite the code
having shipped here.

### Completed this session

**Export API (async BullMQ path)**

- `GET /entity-types/:id/export` — sync path (≤5k rows) returns binary; async path (>5k) enqueues BullMQ job, returns `{ jobId }` with 202
- `GET /exports/:jobId/download` — polls job state; `requireRole("agent", "admin")`; null-guard on `returnvalue` returns `EXPORT_EXPIRED` after TTL; all responses wrapped in `{ data: T }` envelope; cross-tenant and PII gate enforcement (404 not 403)
- `apps/worker` export processor: `renderExportPdf` kept local to `apps/api` and `apps/worker` (dependency boundary: `entity-engine → db only`); pdfkit removed from entity-engine
- `useExport` hook extracted to `apps/admin-ui/src/lib/use-export.ts` and `apps/portal/src/lib/use-export.ts`; 13-test suite covering full polling state machine

**Workflow canvas**

- `PUT /workflows/:id/canvas` — upsert states + transitions in a single transaction; initial-state deletion guard (422); cross-tenant 404
- `WorkflowCanvas` React component: module-level `_newCounter` moved into `useRef` to fix React 18 StrictMode double-invoke; `isAdmin` wired from real Zitadel JWT roles; `beforeunload` guard when canvas is dirty

**Tests added**

- `canvas.test.ts`: 14 unit tests (create/update/delete states+transitions, initial-state guard, cross-tenant 404, role rejection)
- `canvas.isolation.test.ts`: 5 isolation tests incl. cross-tenant 404, initial-state guard, non-admin 403
- `export.isolation.test.ts`: 6 tests — 3 DB-level RLS + 3 HTTP download access-control (cross-tenant, PII gate, allowed case)
- `download.test.ts`: 10 unit tests incl. EXPORT_EXPIRED null-returnvalue case
- `use-export.test.ts`: 13 hook state machine tests (added `@testing-library/react` + jsdom to admin-ui)

### Key decisions / gotchas

- `c.json()` cannot return inside `withTenantContext` callback — threw sentinel error with `.code` and caught it outside
- BullMQ `removeOnComplete: { age: 3600 }` — `job.returnvalue` is `null` after TTL; must null-guard before reading `downloadUrl`
- commitlint: subjects must be entirely lowercase — no camelCase, PascalCase, or acronyms
- Lockfile must be committed after any `package.json` change; CI uses `--frozen-lockfile`

### Phase snapshot

| Track                          | Status                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Track 2D — no-code + reporting | ✅ Done — PR #115 merged |
| Phase 2                        | ✅ **100% complete**     |

### Next

- Phase 2 is complete. Phase 3 planning required before starting 3A–3D.
- Carry-over ADR for export async design (#116) and week-log update (#117) remain open per reviewer notes.

## 2026-06-16 — Track 2D Phase 2 — admin-ui automation builder, saved views, export, workflow editor (issue #15, PR #107)

**Session type:** Feature implementation
**Branch:** `feat/15-track-2d-phase2-admin-ui` → PR #107 open for review

### Completed this session

**Track 2D Phase 2 admin-ui (T10–T21 of 24)**

- **T10** — automation rules list page with enable/disable toggle, delete, link to wizard
- **T11** — `step-trigger.tsx`: trigger type picker + dynamic config (workflow/state selects, entity type/field selects)
- **T12** — `step-conditions.tsx`: recursive conditions builder (AND/OR groups, field comparisons, add/remove/nest)
- **T13** — `step-actions.tsx`: actions builder supporting `notify`, `set_field`, `transition`, `webhook` action types
- **T14** — `step-save.tsx` + `wizard.tsx`: 4-step wizard shell with progress indicator, edit mode pre-populate, POST/PATCH on save
- **T15** — wired `/automations`, `/automations/new`, `/automations/:id/edit` routes in `App.tsx`; nav entry in `layout.tsx`
- **T16** — workflow detail: `StateEditPopover` — clicking a state circle opens inline edit for label/color/SLA, PATCH on save
- **T17** — workflow detail: dnd-kit drag-to-reorder states with optimistic update + rollback on failure
- **T18** — workflow detail: SVG quadratic bezier arcs for non-adjacent transitions (arc height scales with state gap, arrowhead marker)
- **T19** — admin-ui record list: saved views dropdown, auto-apply default view, save-current-filter modal
- **T20** — admin-ui record list: CSV/xlsx export split-button; EXPORT_TOO_LARGE banner
- **T21** — portal record list: same saved views + export (mirrors admin-ui)

**Key implementation notes:**

- `(value as Type) ?? fallback` ESLint pattern: cast must be `as Type | undefined` when `??` is used, otherwise `no-unnecessary-condition` fires
- dnd-kit `setNodeRef` expects `Element | null`; custom `Map<string, HTMLDivElement>` requires `setNodeRef(el as unknown as HTMLElement)` workaround
- `useLayoutEffect` without deps array for SVG arc measurement — intentional, always re-measure after any layout change
- `jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content` rule is not installed in this project; do not add eslint-disable comments for it

### Still pending (Phase 2 gate not fully met)

- **T5** — saved-views RLS isolation test (`tests/isolation/saved-views.test.ts`) — needs Docker; deferred

## 2026-06-16 — Track 2D Phase 1 — saved views API + entity export (issue #15)

**Session type:** Feature implementation
**Branch state:** `main`, 1 commit ahead of origin (6d804f0)

### Completed this session

**Track 2D Phase 1 backend (T1–T4, T6–T9 of 24)**

- **T1** — migration 0018: `saved_views` table with dual RLS policy (`tenant_id` + `user_id` GUCs), cascade FK to `entity_types`, analytics comment included
- **T2** — Drizzle schema (`packages/db/src/schema/saved-views.ts`); `withTenantAndUserContext` helper added to `packages/db/src/middleware.ts` — sets both `app.tenant_id` and `app.user_id` in one call
- **T3** — saved-views CRUD: `GET /saved-views?entityTypeId=`, `POST /saved-views` (max-20 limit, userId always from auth), `PATCH /saved-views/:id`, `DELETE /saved-views/:id`; wired into `app.ts`
- **T4** — 11-test unit suite: list, create 201, max-20 → 409, userId injection prevention, isDefault clears prior, update 200/404, delete 204/404 — all passing
- **T6–T8** — `GET /entity-types/:id/export?format=csv|xlsx`; PII/financial field exclusion by role; EXPORT_TOO_LARGE guard at 10k; system cols first; exceljs bold header + auto-width; routed before `/:id` to avoid conflict
- **T9** — 14-test export suite: CSV/xlsx content-types, PII exclusion by role (agent vs pii_export/admin), EXPORT_TOO_LARGE, empty → headers-only, 404 on missing entity type — all passing

**Key implementation notes:**

- `getEntityType` throws `EntityError("ENTITY_TYPE_NOT_FOUND")` rather than returning null — caught and mapped to 404
- xlsx uses `c.newResponse()` not `new Response()` to avoid undici-types portability error
- `requireAuth()` mock in export tests is a pass-through so `makeApp(roles)` controls per-test role

### Still pending (Phase 1 gate not fully met)

- **T5** — saved-views RLS isolation test (`tests/isolation/saved-views.test.ts`) — needs Docker stack running; skipping until integration environment is available

## 2026-06-16 — Pre-pilot engine fixes (#76–#84); PR #89 merged

**Session type:** Bug fix / pre-pilot hardening
**Branch state:** `main`, clean (PR #89 merged — f51ac01)

### Completed this session

**9 issues closed (#74–#84 scope — #74/#75 were prior, #76–#84 this session)**

- **#76 — ioredis migration**: created `@platform/redis` singleton package (`getRedis`, `closeRedis`); removed `node-redis` from `entity-engine`; schema-cache SCAN cursor fixed to string `"0"`, SET EX uses ioredis positional args, DEL spreads keys
- **#77 — idempotency pre-lock**: moved idempotency read-only SELECT before `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` in `executeTransition` to short-circuit without acquiring the write lock
- **#78 — bulkCreateEntities O(N) DB calls**: request-scoped `Map` caches `entityType` + `allFields` per `typeId`; schema stays per-item (uses its own Redis cache)
- **#79 — deleteEntity single round-trip**: collapsed SELECT + UPDATE into `UPDATE...RETURNING` with `isNull(deletedAt)` in WHERE
- **#80 — error handler messages**: workflow and entity engine errors return human-readable `message` fields instead of raw codes
- **#81 — ActionConfig discriminated union**: replaced `Record<string,unknown>` config + unsafe casts in executor with a typed discriminated union; all switch arms narrow cleanly
- **#82 — duplicate migration prefixes**: renumbered `0001`/`0002` collisions to sequential `0002`/`0003`/`0004`; Drizzle journal updated
- **#83 — automation-engine notify async**: removed spurious `async` from `executeNotifyAction` (no await); added TODO for re-wire
- **#84 — /health NODE_ENV leak**: removed `env: env.NODE_ENV` from health response body

**PR #89 review fixes (two rounds):**

- Added `server.deps.inline` for `@platform/redis` + `@platform/db` to all three engine vitest configs
- Wired `closeRedis()` into graceful shutdown for `apps/api` (new SIGTERM/SIGINT handler) and `apps/worker`
- Fixed residual `isRedisReady()` call in `invalidateSchemaCache`
- Added 6-test suite for `@platform/redis` (singleton, constructor args, error handler, quit, reset, no-op)
- Fixed `tsconfig.json` to exclude test files from tsc build
- `server.close()` wrapped in `Promise` so in-flight requests drain before `closeRedis()` on SIGTERM

## 2026-06-10 — Tenant lifecycle (issue #5 items 1+2); PR #86 open

**Session type:** Implementation
**Branch state:** `feat/PLAT-5-tenant-lifecycle`, PR #86 open

### Completed this session

**Issue #5 — Tenant lifecycle, items 1+2 (item 3 outbox retention deferred)**

- **Migration 0013**: `suspended_at` and `deletion_scheduled_at` columns on `tenants`; partial index `tenants_deletion_due_idx` for purge worker
- **`packages/auth` — tenant status cache**: 30 s TTL Map-based cache (`tenant-status-cache.ts`); `invalidateTenantStatusCache` exported; auth middleware enforces 403 (suspended) / 404 (deleted / purged) on every authenticated request
- **`apps/api` — tenant-lifecycle service**: `provisionTenant`, `suspendTenant`, `reactivateTenant`, `scheduleTenantDeletion`; typed `TenantLifecycleError`; cache invalidated on every transition; 30-day BullMQ purge job enqueued by `scheduleTenantDeletion`
- **Admin routes** `/admin/tenants` (POST / GET / PATCH suspend+reactivate / DELETE): all gated by `requireRole("superadmin") + requireIntrospection()`
- **`apps/worker` — tenant-purge BullMQ worker**: concurrency=1; FK-safe deletion order; audit log retained; marks tenant `purged` on completion; idempotent
- **Tests**: 9 unit tests (lifecycle service); auth middleware mock updated for `db`/`tenants` imports; 38/38 typecheck clean; 21/21 auth tests pass

## 2026-06-09 — 2A Phase 3 complete (T18–T23); PR #85 updated

**Session type:** Implementation
**Branch state:** `feat/PLAT-12-platform-services-2a`, ahead of `main`, PR #85 open

### Completed this session

**2A Phase 3 — PII-aware audit snapshots + integration / isolation tests**

- **T18 — audit hook in entity engine**: added `audit-hook.ts` with `registerEntityAuditHook` / `fireEntityAuditHook` / `isEntityAuditHookRegistered`. Preserves `packages/entity-engine → packages/db only` dependency rule — hook is a callback registered by `apps/api` at startup, not a direct import.
- Entity engine `createEntity`, `updateEntity`, `deleteEntity` now fire the hook with before/after snapshots and the field sensitivity map.
- `apps/api/src/app.ts` registers `writeAuditEntry` as the hook at module load, inside the same DB transaction.
- **T19 — files RLS isolation test**: 5 assertions — cross-tenant read blocked, own-tenant read allowed, cross-tenant delete returns FILE_NOT_FOUND, cross-tenant `confirmUpload` throws FileError.
- **T20 — audit_log RLS isolation test**: 4 assertions — cross-tenant raw SELECT blocked, `queryAuditLog` API scoped to correct tenant.
- **T21 — view_configs RLS isolation test**: 5 assertions — cross-tenant read + write (INSERT WITH CHECK) blocked.
- **T22 — upload flow integration**: 6 tests — `initiateUpload` → `confirmUpload` → `getDownloadUrl` → quarantine guard → `deleteFile` → size limit guard.
- **T23 — quarantine lifecycle integration**: 6 tests — `pending` download blocked, quarantined blocked, `scan_failed` blocked, clean succeeds, idempotent re-download.
- Fixed wrong function names (`completeUpload` → `confirmUpload(db, redis, tenantId, fileId)`, `downloadFile` → `getDownloadUrl`) in all three test files.
- Fixed `FieldSensitivity` re-export: `workflow-engine/index.ts` now re-exports it from `@platform/entity-engine` so `@platform/audit` can import transitively.
- All 141 unit tests pass. Integration/isolation tests require `docker compose up -d` (expected).

### Phase snapshot

- Phase 1: **100% complete**
- Phase 2 — 2A: **~95%** (pending: CI green on Docker test suite before merge)
- Phase 2 — 2B/2C/2D: 0% (next)

### Next actions

- [ ] CI must pass on full Docker stack before merging PR #85
- [ ] Start 2B: module system + seed SQL for helpdesk, CRM, reimbursements
- [ ] Phase exit decision (2A → 2B) requires human sign-off

## 2026-06-09 — 2A Phase 1 + 2 complete; SSRF/PII PR merged

**Session type:** Implementation
**Branch state:** `feat/PLAT-12-platform-services-2a`, ahead of `main`, PR open

### Completed this session

**SSRF + PII hardening (PR #73 — merged)**

- Fixed `opts.all = true` crash in `webhook.ts` `lookupFn` (`ERR_INVALID_IP_ADDRESS` on Docker happy-eyeballs path)
- PR reviewed by abmish, all 6 blockers resolved, CI green, merged to main

**2A Phase 1 — packages**

- `@platform/notifications`: Novu wrapper, user preference CRUD, `sendNotification`, `getUserPreferences`, `updateUserPreferences`
- `@platform/files`: `initiateUpload` (S3 presigned PUT, quota guard, AV scan queue enqueue), `completeUpload`, `downloadFile`, `deleteFile`, `FileError`
- `@platform/audit`: `writeAuditEntry`, `queryAuditLog`, PII redaction via `redactMetadata` + `buildSensitivityMap`
- DB migrations 0007–0009: `files`, `view_configs`, `audit_log` tables (all with RLS, tenant indexes)

**2A Phase 2 — API routes + workers**

- `apps/api`: file initiate/complete/download/delete routes, admin audit log + view-config routes, notification preferences get/patch routes, `/openapi.json` endpoint, shared Redis client
- `apps/worker`: av-scan BullMQ worker (ClamAV INSTREAM TCP, lazy S3, quarantine notification), file-cleanup hourly recurring worker (purges stale pending files, implicit quota via row deletion)
- 34 tests: 12 file API route tests, 3 av-scan tests, 4 file-cleanup tests (all green)

**Test infra fixes**

- vitest 4.x: `S3Client` and `net.Socket` constructor mocks must use `function` keyword (not arrow function)
- BullMQ Worker processor captured at import time; `beforeEach` must NOT clear the reference

### Phase snapshot

- Phase 1: **100% complete**
- Phase 2 — 2A: **~65%** (Phase 3 integration tests T19–T23 remain)
- Phase 2 — 2B/2C/2D: 0% (next)

### Next actions

- [ ] 2A Phase 3 (T19–T23): isolation + integration tests for files, audit, view-configs; full upload flow; quarantine flow
- [ ] Start 2B: module system + seed SQL for helpdesk, CRM, reimbursements
- [ ] T18 (PII-aware snapshots): wire `buildSensitivityMap` + `redactMetadata` into entity engine hooks
