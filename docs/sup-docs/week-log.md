# Week-over-Week Progress Log

**Format:** One entry per session or per milestone close. Newest at top.
**Purpose:** Running velocity record for an AI-first dev team. Update this at the start/end of each work session.

## 2026-06-09 — 2A Phase 1 + 2 complete; SSRF/PII PR merged

**Session type:** Implementation
**Branch state:** `feat/PLAT-12-platform-services-2a`, ahead of `main`, PR open

### Completed this session

**SSRF + PII hardening (PR #73 — merged)**

- Fixed `opts.all = true` crash in `webhook.ts` `lookupFn` (`ERR_INVALID_IP_ADDRESS` on Docker happy-eyeballs path)
- PR reviewed by abmish, all 6 blockers resolved, CI green, merged to main

**2A Phase 1 — packages**

- `@platform/notifications`: Novu wrapper, user preference CRUD, `sendNotification`, `getUserPreferences`, `updateUserPreferences`
- `@platform/files`: `initiateUpload` (S3 presigned PUT, quota guard, AV scan queue enqueue), `completeUpload`, `downloadFile`, `deleteFile`, `FileError`
- `@platform/audit`: `writeAuditEntry`, `queryAuditLog`, PII redaction via `redactMetadata` + `buildSensitivityMap`
- DB migrations 0007–0009: `files`, `view_configs`, `audit_log` tables (all with RLS, tenant indexes)

**2A Phase 2 — API routes + workers**

- `apps/api`: file initiate/complete/download/delete routes, admin audit log + view-config routes, notification preferences get/patch routes, `/openapi.json` endpoint, shared Redis client
- `apps/worker`: av-scan BullMQ worker (ClamAV INSTREAM TCP, lazy S3, quarantine notification), file-cleanup hourly recurring worker (purges stale pending files, implicit quota via row deletion)
- 34 tests: 12 file API route tests, 3 av-scan tests, 4 file-cleanup tests (all green)

**Test infra fixes**

- vitest 4.x: `S3Client` and `net.Socket` constructor mocks must use `function` keyword (not arrow function)
- BullMQ Worker processor captured at import time; `beforeEach` must NOT clear the reference

### Phase snapshot

- Phase 1: **100% complete**
- Phase 2 — 2A: **~65%** (Phase 3 integration tests T19–T23 remain)
- Phase 2 — 2B/2C/2D: 0% (next)

### Next actions

- [ ] 2A Phase 3 (T19–T23): isolation + integration tests for files, audit, view-configs; full upload flow; quarantine flow
- [ ] Start 2B: module system + seed SQL for helpdesk, CRM, reimbursements
- [ ] T18 (PII-aware snapshots): wire `buildSensitivityMap` + `redactMetadata` into entity engine hooks

## 2026-05-22 — Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 triage

**Session type:** Analysis + cleanup
**Branch state:** `main`, clean

### Completed this session

- Deleted stale local branch `feat/PLAT-007-infrastructure-tenancy-secrets`
- Removed `contributor` remote tracking ref
- Created `docs/sup-docs/` tracking suite

### Phase snapshot

- Phase 1: **100% complete** (all 5 tracks + security hardening closed)
- Phase 2: **0% started** — 4 tracks open, 7 carry-over issues to triage
- Phase 3: **0% started**

### Open Phase 2 blockers to triage

- #3 Workflow reliability gaps (PrabhuVijit — assigned, no PR yet)
- #5 Tenant lifecycle / audit log / outbox retention (abmish — architecture decision pending)
- #2 Data isolation & PII leakage (unassigned)
- #4 Schema cache & Redis efficiency (unassigned)
- #62 Workflow version GC + stuck instances (unassigned)
- #64 Transition rollback / undo policy (unassigned)
- #65 Parallel approval edge cases (unassigned)

### Carry-over triage completed (same session)

- ✅ Closed #3 (tracker — all sub-items resolved)
- ✅ Closed #64 (transition rollback → irreversible by design, ADR-002 WE-02 resolved)
- 🔴 #2 flagged PILOT BLOCKER — SSRF + PII, must land before any customer data
- 🟡 #5 folded into 2A — items 1+2 are 2A work; item 3 deferred to load testing
- 🟡 #4 deferred to pre-GA / load testing
- 🟡 #62 deferred to before 2D (workflow editor)
- 🟡 #65 re-labelled phase:3 — parallel approval off-limits for pilot

### Next actions

- [ ] Start 2A — platform services (Novu, files, audit log, view_configs)
- [ ] #2 (SSRF + PII) must be assigned and worked in parallel with 2A
- [ ] #5 items 1+2 land as part of 2A
