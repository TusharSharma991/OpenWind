/**
 * Reproduces the production outage caused by 0050_outbox_events_rls.sql:
 * outbox-poller.ts / notification-poller.ts sweep outbox_events across all
 * tenants in one query and can't set app.tenant_id (there is no single
 * tenant to scope a cross-tenant sweep to). Under app_user (NOBYPASSRLS),
 * with app.tenant_id unset the RLS USING clause's `::uuid` cast either
 * raises `invalid input syntax for type uuid` (observed in production logs,
 * likely a stale non-NULL GUC left on a pooled connection) or, on a clean
 * session where current_setting(...) returns NULL, silently filters every
 * row out — either way, the sweep never sees any tenant's events, so no
 * automation triggers or in-app/email notifications were delivered
 * platform-wide.
 *
 * Two independent fixes for this same outage now both exist:
 * 0053_outbox_sweeper_role.sql (this repo's own direct-to-server hotfix,
 * predates PR #374) grants a narrowly-scoped BYPASSRLS role to the three
 * sweep call sites via SET LOCAL ROLE. 0059_outbox_dead_letter_rls_null_guc_fix.sql
 * (PR #374, merged later upstream) takes a broader approach: it widens the
 * RLS policy itself so ANY app_user connection with no tenant context (NULL
 * or the pgbouncer placeholder '') gets batch access, not just the three
 * call sites that opt into outbox_sweeper. Since 0059's policy is now the
 * effective one, plain app_user with no context correctly succeeds too —
 * outbox_sweeper is a redundant-but-harmless belt-and-suspenders mechanism
 * for exactly the three call sites that use it, not the sole gate anymore.
 *
 * Uses a real Postgres database (no mocks).
