# Specs index

Feature specs written with `/spec`, plus their `-tasks.md` plan companions from `/spec-tasks`.
**Specs stay at their original path once shipped.** Only their `-tasks.md` companions are removed. Code comments and tests cite
`docs/specs/<name>.md`, so moving a spec breaks those references. Mark it `implemented` and
list it here instead.

Status values (`.claude/commands/spec.md`): `draft` → `review` → `approved` → `in-progress` →
`implemented (PR #N)`, or `abandoned` (abandoned specs are deleted unless code cites them). When a spec's PR merges, update its header and this table in
the same PR.

Last reconciled: 2026-09-28 (#694).

The third-party API specs are per-phase delivery detail. The cross-cutting rules and index live
in [`docs/third-party-api-design.md`](../third-party-api-design.md), and the decision is ADR-012.

## Removed after shipping

Once a spec ships, its `-tasks.md` plan companion is deleted unless code cites it or it still
tracks deferred work, because git history and the PR already hold that record. The spec itself
stays. On 2026-09-27 (#694) the tasks files for 14 shipped specs were removed (`backup-dr-runbook`,
`hosted-ticket-create-handoff`, `network-status-awareness`, `team-assign-oncall-fallback`,
`third-party-key-external-org-mapping` and the nine `third-party-api-*` specs), along
with the abandoned `workflow-id-based-linking` spec and its tasks file. Recover any of them with
`c=$(git log --diff-filter=D --format=%h -1 -- docs/specs/<name>.md); git show "$c^:docs/specs/<name>.md"`.

### Specs still cited by code

The 2026-09-18 docs restructure (PR #619, commit `94fbaa2`) deleted shipped specs that code
comments and tests still cite. Recover any of them with `git show 94fbaa2^:docs/specs/<name>.md`:

`2d-no-code-builders-reporting`, `api-request-observability`, `auto-logout-on-inactivity`,
`child-tickets`, `connector-kill-switch` (+tasks), `connector-polling-scheduler` (+tasks),
`due-date`, `group-e-withtenant-context-gaps`, `in-app-notification-hub`,
`local-disk-file-storage` (+tasks), `packages-ui-button-primitive`, `personal-dashboard`,
`security-group-b-api-access-control`, `settings-page-tabs-redesign`, `tenant-org-id-mapping`,
`tenant-scoped-rate-limit-195`, `ticket-alerts`, `ticket-live-updates`, `ticket-reference-linking`,
`workflow-open-ticket-creation` (+tasks).

The ADR drafts `adr-016-draft-oncall-routing` and `adr-017-draft-temporal-scheduler` were removed
in commit `88cd43c` (#591) once the ADRs were accepted. Recover them with
`git show 88cd43c^:docs/specs/<name>.md`.

These paths are cited but were never committed: `dashboard-severity-tags-origin-tasks`,
`docs-config-hygiene-193-203-204`, `port-nexus-ow-fixes`, `third-party-api-phase-c-interaction-api`,
`user-auth`.
