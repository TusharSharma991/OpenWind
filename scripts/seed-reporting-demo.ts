/**
 * seed-reporting-demo.ts
 *
 * Generates realistic ticket history so the reporting dashboards have
 * something meaningful to measure. Without it the platform holds ~15 tickets,
 * which is not enough for a median, a distribution, or a heatmap to mean
 * anything (docs/specs/superset-embedded-dashboarding.md P5).
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm exec dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx scripts/seed-reporting-demo.ts
 *
 * Safe to re-run: every ticket it creates is tagged, and a re-run adds a new
 * batch rather than duplicating an existing one. Use `pnpm reset:data` for a
 * clean slate.
 *
 * ── Why this goes through the engines, not INSERT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Every row here is written by the same functions the API routes use:
 *
 *   createEntity()      — validates fields against the entity's own Zod schema
 *   executeTransition() — validates against workflow_transitions, takes the
 *                         row lock, writes the workflow_events row, moves
 *                         current_state
 *   comment insert      — exactly the shape apps/api/src/routes/entities/
 *                         add-comment.ts writes
 *
 * That matters for reporting specifically. Response-time, dwell-time and
 * transition tiles are computed from the workflow_events trail, so seeded data
 * is only useful if that trail is genuine. Inserting entity_instances rows
 * directly would produce tickets with plausible current states and no history
 * at all — dashboards would render, and every duration on them would be wrong.
 *
 * It also means this script cannot invent an illegal state change: a
 * transition the workflow does not define is rejected by the engine, the same
 * as it would be for a real user.
