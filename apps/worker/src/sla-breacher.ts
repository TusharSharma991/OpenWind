/**
 * SLA Breacher — BullMQ worker that fires when a delayed SLA job becomes due.
 *
 * Guard: before writing the breach event it checks that the entity instance is
 * still in the expected state.  If the instance has already transitioned away,
 * the job is a no-op.  This handles the race where the transition and the job
 * fire concurrently — the engine's cancelPendingSlaTimers only covers jobs that
 * haven't been enqueued yet.
 *
 * Atomicity (G1): the state guard SELECT and the outbox INSERT are wrapped in a
 * single transaction.  Without this, a concurrent executeTransition committing
 * between the guard read and the INSERT would pass the guard check but write a
 * breach event for a state the instance had already left (TOCTOU).
 *
 * Retries (G2): the slaQueue is created with defaultJobOptions.attempts=3 and
 * exponential backoff.  On final exhaustion the "failed" event handler writes
 * to dead_letter_events so operators can inspect and re-trigger rather than
 * silently losing the breach.
